# Test Case: /sh:spec Command Validation

**Test ID**: TC-001
**Priority**: Critical
**Category**: Behavioral/Analysis
**Estimated Time**: 10 minutes

## Objective

Validate that /sh:spec command produces 8-dimensional complexity analysis with correct Shannon behavioral patterns, artifact generation, and MCP recommendations.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Serena MCP configured and functional
- [ ] .shannon/ directory cleared (fresh start)
- [ ] Test environment: /Users/nick/Documents/shannon

## Test Steps

### Step 1: Environment Setup

```bash
# Clear previous test artifacts
cd /Users/nick/Documents/shannon
rm -rf .shannon/analysis/spec_*.md
mkdir -p .shannon/analysis
mkdir -p test-results/TC-001/{artifacts,screenshots,logs}
```

**Expected**: Directories created without errors

### Step 2: Execute /sh:spec Command

**Command**:
```
/sh:spec "Build a todo application with user authentication, task management, and real-time notifications"

## 5-Phase Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Discovery & Analysis
**Tasks**:
1. Define todo data model and relationships
2. Document authentication requirements (JWT vs session)
3. Identify notification delivery mechanisms
**Validation Gate**: Requirements documented, architecture approved

[... continues for all 5 phases ...]

## Timeline Estimation

**Total Duration**: 3-4 weeks

**Phase Breakdown**:
- Phase 1: 3-4 days
- Phase 2: 4-5 days
- Phase 3: 8-10 days
- Phase 4: 4-5 days
- Phase 5: 2-3 days

## Risk Assessment

**High Priority Risks**:
1. **Authentication Security**: Mitigation - use established libraries, security audit
2. **Real-time Performance**: Mitigation - load testing, connection pooling
3. **Data Integrity**: Mitigation - transaction handling, validation

## Wave Orchestration Strategy

**Recommended Wave Count**: 4 waves

**Wave Boundaries**:
1. Wave 1: Authentication system
2. Wave 2: Todo CRUD operations
3. Wave 3: Real-time notifications
4. Wave 4: Integration and polish

**Rationale**: Complexity 0.68 justifies 4 waves for systematic development
