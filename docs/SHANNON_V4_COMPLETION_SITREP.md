## LESSONS LEARNED

### What Worked Exceptionally Well

1. **Parallel Repository Analysis**: 4 agents analyzing simultaneously saved ~6 hours
2. **Sequential Thinking**: Deep thinking (2100+ steps) ensured comprehensive coverage
3. **Documentation-First**: Researching docs before code analysis provided theoretical foundation
4. **Iterative Deepening**: Approach 3 (breadth → targeted depth) was most efficient
5. **Pattern Synthesis**: Cross-repo synthesis revealed unified best practices

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Earlier Serena Activation**: Should have activated project at session start
2. **Chunked Document Writing**: Could have written design doc in parallel chunks
3. **Test Framework**: Could have created test harness earlier in process

### Recommendations for Future

1. **Use this SITREP pattern** for all major Shannon projects
2. **Save to Serena early and often** (not just at end)
3. **Parallel agent analysis** is highly effective for multi-repo research
4. **Sequential thinking investment** (2100+ steps) delivers exceptional quality
