    ↓
Serena Memory: analysis_[dimension]_[timestamp]
```

**Memory Schema**:
```yaml
analysis_evidence:
  target: "path/to/analyzed/code"
  dimension: "quality|architecture|performance|security|..."
  timestamp: ISO-8601
  findings:
    - finding_id: unique_id
      severity: critical|high|medium|low|info
      category: specific_category
      description: detailed_finding
      evidence:
        file: source_file_path
        line_range: [start, end]
        code_snippet: relevant_code
      impact: user/business/technical_impact

    high_count: count
    quality_score: 0-100
  patterns_detected:
    - pattern_name: description
  anti_patterns_detected:
    - anti_pattern_name: description
```

## Execution Flow with Structured Analysis

### Phase 1: Initialization

```
1. Parse Command
   - Extract target (file/directory/module)
   - Parse flags and options
   - Determine analysis scope

2. Load Context
   - read_memory("spec_analysis") → Project understanding
   - read_memory("architecture_design") → Intended structure
   - read_memory("previous_analysis_*") → Historical findings
   - list_memories() → Available project context

3. Activate ANALYZER Agent
   - Primary: ANALYZER (coordination)
   - Secondary: Domain specialists based on focus flags
   - MCP Servers: Serena (required), Sequential (analysis), Context7 (patterns)
```

### Phase 2: Scope Discovery

```
1. Determine Analysis Scope
   - Single file → Quick analysis template
   - Module/directory → Comprehensive analysis template
   - System-wide → Wave orchestration template

2. File Discovery (if directory/system)
   - Glob patterns for file types
   - Respect .gitignore
   - Categorize by domain (frontend/backend/config/tests)

3. Complexity Assessment
   - Count files, lines, modules
   - Identify integration points
   - Assess technical stack
   - Determine parallelization opportunities
```

### Phase 3: Analysis Execution

**Single File Flow**:
```
1. Read target file (Read tool)

2. Wave 2: Domain specialists analyze in parallel → save findings
3. Wave 3: ANALYZER synthesizes → comprehensive report
4. Cross-wave: All subsequent waves can reference analysis findings

---

## Quality Standards

### Analysis Completeness

**Required Elements**:
- ✅ Evidence for every finding (file, line, code snippet)
- ✅ Severity rating with justification
- ✅ Impact assessment (user/business/technical)
- ✅ Actionable recommendation with effort estimate
- ✅ Pattern identification (good and anti-patterns)

### Evidence Chain Integrity

**Verification Requirements**:
- Every finding traces to specific code location
- Every recommendation backed by evidence
- Every pattern claim supported by examples
- All analysis reproducible by others

### Report Quality

**Standards**:
- Executive summary provides clear business value
- Findings organized logically by dimension and severity
- Recommendations prioritized by impact and effort
- Action plan provides clear implementation roadmap
- Technical depth appropriate for audience

---

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies

**For Large Codebases** (>500 files):
- Enable wave mode for parallel analysis
- Use targeted focus flags to limit scope
- Leverage Serena cached patterns from previous analyses
- Consider module-by-module analysis vs. full system

**For Quick Scans** (time-constrained):
- Use --quick flag for quality + architecture only
- Focus on critical paths and high-risk areas
- Skip low-priority dimensions
- Generate summary report instead of detailed

**Token Efficiency**:
- Use --uc flag with symbol-based communication
- Generate concise findings tables
- Defer detailed evidence to Serena (reference by ID)
- Use structured templates for consistent format

---

## Best Practices

### Before Analysis

1. **Load Context**: Always `read_memory("spec_analysis")` first
2. **Clarify Scope**: Confirm target and analysis dimensions with user if ambiguous
3. **Check Previous Analyses**: Avoid duplicate work by checking Serena memories
4. **Assess Complexity**: Determine if wave mode needed based on scope

### During Analysis

1. **Evidence First**: Always capture code evidence before making claims
2. **Structured Findings**: Use consistent schema for all findings
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Look for recurring issues and architectural themes
4. **Cross-Reference**: Check findings against best practices via Context7
5. **Progressive Depth**: Start broad, drill into specifics as needed

### After Analysis

1. **Save Everything**: Log all findings and evidence to Serena
2. **Actionable Recommendations**: Every finding needs a clear fix path
3. **Effort Estimation**: Provide realistic effort for all recommendations
4. **Action Plan**: Organize recommendations into implementable phases
5. **Context Contribution**: Ensure analysis results available for future waves

---

## Integration with Testing Philosophy

### Analysis for Testing

When analyzing code for testing purposes:

1. **Test Coverage Analysis**:
   - Identify untested code paths
   - Assess test quality (assertions, edge cases)
   - Find missing integration tests
   - Evaluate functional test coverage

2. **NO MOCKS Validation**:
   - Identify areas using mocks inappropriately
   - Suggest functional test alternatives
   - Recommend Puppeteer/simulator testing
   - Align with Shannon testing philosophy

3. **Test Recommendations**:
   - Prioritize critical paths for functional testing
   - Suggest test scenarios based on code analysis
   - Identify integration points needing validation
   - Recommend testing tools (Puppeteer for web, XCTest for iOS)

---
