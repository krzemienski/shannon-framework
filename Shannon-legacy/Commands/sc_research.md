## Shannon V3 Enhancements

### 1. Evidence Tracking Framework

**Evidence Chain Structure**:
```
Query → Search → Sources → Extraction → Analysis → Synthesis
   ↓
Serena Memory: research_[topic]_[timestamp]
```

**Memory Schema**:
```yaml
research_evidence:
  query: "original research question"
  topic: extracted_topic_keywords
  timestamp: ISO-8601
  strategy_used: "planning_only|intent_planning|unified"
  depth: "quick|standard|deep|exhaustive"

  search_rounds:
    - round_id: 1
      queries: ["search query 1", "search query 2"]
      sources_found: count
      parallel_execution: true

  sources:
    - source_id: unique_id
      url: source_url
      title: source_title
      credibility_tier: 1-4
      credibility_score: 0.0-1.0
      relevance_score: 0.0-1.0
      extraction_method: "tavily|playwright|context7"
      content_summary: key_points
      timestamp: when_accessed

  findings:
    - finding_id: unique_id
      claim: specific_finding
      evidence: supporting_sources[]
      confidence: 0.0-1.0
      contradictions: conflicting_sources[]
      verification_status: "verified|disputed|uncertain"

  synthesis:
    key_insights: [primary findings]
    convergent_themes: [areas of agreement]
    contradictions_resolved: [how conflicts handled]
    gaps_identified: [missing information]
    confidence_overall: 0.0-1.0

  metadata:
    total_sources: count
    hops_executed: count
    time_taken_seconds: duration
    patterns_learned: [successful patterns]
    queries_effective: [best performing queries]
```

### 2. Research History & Case-Based Learning

**Case Storage** (via Serena):
```yaml
research_case:
  case_id: "research_[timestamp]_[topic_hash]"
  query_type: "technical|academic|market|competitive|verification"
  complexity: 0.0-1.0

  successful_patterns:
    query_formulations: ["effective query patterns"]
    extraction_methods: ["best tools for content type"]
    synthesis_approaches: ["how to combine sources"]

  lessons_learned:
    what_worked: [effective strategies]
    what_failed: [unsuccessful approaches]
    optimizations: [improvements discovered]

  reuse_metrics:
    times_referenced: count
    success_rate: 0.0-1.0
    adaptation_needed: true|false
```

**Cross-Session Learning**:
- Similar query detection → retrieve relevant cases
- Pattern matching → apply successful strategies
- Query optimization → learn from effective formulations
- Source selection → prefer high-credibility domains from history
- Extraction routing → remember which tools worked for content types

### 3. Source Credibility Matrix

**Four-Tier Credibility System**:
```yaml
tier_1_sources:
  score_range: 0.9-1.0
  types:
    - Academic journals (peer-reviewed)
    - Government publications (.gov)
    - Official documentation (technical specs)
    - Primary research papers
  validation: cite-able, authoritative

tier_2_sources:
  score_range: 0.7-0.9
  types:
    - Established media organizations
    - Industry research reports
    - Expert blogs (verified authors)
    - Technical forums (Stack Overflow)
  validation: reputable, verifiable

tier_3_sources:
  score_range: 0.5-0.7
  types:
    - Community resources (GitHub wikis)
    - User documentation
    - Social media (verified accounts)
    - Wikipedia (cross-referenced)
  validation: useful, requires verification

tier_4_sources:
  score_range: 0.3-0.5
  types:
    - User forums (unverified)
    - Social media (unverified)
    - Personal blogs (unknown authors)
    - Comment sections
  validation: supplementary only, cross-check required
```

**Confidence Scoring Algorithm**:
```
confidence = (relevance × 0.5) + (credibility × 0.5)

Where:
- relevance: 0.0-1.0 (how well source addresses query)
- credibility: tier_score (0.3-1.0 based on source tier)
```

### 4. Multi-Hop Research Patterns

**Hop Types**:
```yaml
entity_expansion:
  description: "Explore entities mentioned in sources"
  example: "Paper → Authors → Other Works → Collaborators"
  max_branches: 3
  parallel: true

concept_deepening:
  description: "Drill down into concepts"
  example: "Topic → Subtopics → Technical Details → Implementation Examples"
  max_depth: 4
  parallel: false (sequential deepening)

temporal_progression:
  description: "Follow chronological development"
  example: "Current State → Recent Updates → Historical Context → Origins"
  direction: backward
  parallel: true (different time periods)

causal_chain:
  description: "Trace cause and effect"
  example: "Effect → Immediate Cause → Root Cause → Prevention Strategies"
  validation: required
  parallel: false (causal dependencies)
```

### 5. Intelligent Extraction Routing

**Content Complexity Analysis**:
```yaml
simple_content:
  indicators: [static_html, article_structure, public_access]
  route_to: tavily_extraction
  processing_time: < 5 seconds

complex_content:
  indicators: [javascript_rendering, dynamic_content, interactive_elements]
  route_to: playwright_extraction
  processing_time: 10-30 seconds

technical_docs:
  indicators: [api_references, framework_guides, library_documentation]
  route_to: context7_lookup
  processing_time: < 10 seconds

authenticated_content:
  indicators: [login_required, paywall, restricted_access]
  route_to: skip_with_note
  fallback: search_for_alternatives
```

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Usage
```bash
/sc:research "latest developments in quantum computing 2024"
```

### With Depth Control
```bash
/sc:research "competitive analysis of AI coding assistants" --depth deep
```

### With Planning Strategy
```bash
/sc:research "best practices for distributed systems" --strategy unified
```

### With Focus Area
```bash
/sc:research "React Server Components" --focus technical --depth standard
```

---

## Execution Flow

### Phase 1: Understanding & Planning (15-25% effort)

**Step 1.1: Query Analysis**
- Parse query for keywords, intent, domain
- Assess complexity and ambiguity
- Detect query type (technical, academic, market, etc.)
- Check research history for similar queries

**Step 1.2: Strategy Selection**
```yaml
planning_only:
  triggers:
    - Clear, specific query
    - Technical documentation request
    - Well-defined scope
  process: Direct execution, no clarification

intent_planning:
  triggers:
    - Ambiguous terms present
    - Broad topic area
    - Multiple interpretations possible
  process: Ask 1-3 clarifying questions → adjust plan

unified:
  triggers:
    - Complex multi-faceted query
    - User collaboration beneficial
    - High-stakes research
  process: Present full plan → get feedback → adjust → execute
```

**Step 1.3: Research Plan Generation**
- Decompose query into sub-questions
- Identify parallelization opportunities
- Select hop patterns (entity, concept, temporal, causal)
- Define success criteria and confidence thresholds

### Phase 2: Task Creation (5% effort)

**TodoWrite Generation**:
```yaml
quick_depth: 3-5 tasks
standard_depth: 5-10 tasks
deep_depth: 10-15 tasks
exhaustive_depth: 15-20 tasks

task_structure:
  - "Initial broad searches (parallel)"
  - "Source credibility assessment"
  - "Content extraction (parallel by complexity)"
  - "Hop [N]: [specific exploration]"
  - "Contradiction resolution"
  - "Synthesis and report generation"
  - "Evidence storage in Serena"
```

### Phase 3: Execution (50-60% effort)

**Step 3.1: Initial Search Round**
```yaml
execution_pattern:
  parallel_queries: true  # ALWAYS DEFAULT
  batch_size: 3-5 queries
  tools: [Tavily MCP]

search_formulation:
  - Generate 3-5 query variations
  - Include domain filters if relevant
  - Apply time filters for current topics
  - Use advanced search operators

parallel_execution:
  # Execute all searches simultaneously
  [Tavily search query1] + [Tavily search query2] + [Tavily search query3]
```

**Step 3.2: Source Credibility Assessment**
```yaml
for each source:
  - Extract domain and author info
  - Classify into tier (1-4)
  - Calculate credibility score
  - Tag content type (article, paper, documentation)
  - Log to Serena evidence chain
```

**Step 3.3: Content Extraction (Parallel by Complexity)**
```yaml
extraction_batching:
  simple_batch: [source1, source2, source3] → Tavily parallel
  complex_batch: [source4, source5] → Playwright sequential
  technical_batch: [source6] → Context7 lookup

parallel_pattern:
  # Group by extraction method, execute in parallel
  Tavily(simple_batch) + Playwright(complex[0]) + Context7(technical)
```

**Step 3.4: Multi-Hop Exploration**
```yaml
hop_execution:
  hop_1: "Entity expansion from initial results"
    - Extract key entities (people, companies, technologies)
    - Generate entity-focused queries
    - Execute parallel searches

  hop_2: "Concept deepening"
    - Identify core concepts needing elaboration
    - Generate concept-specific queries
    - Execute sequential deepening

  hop_3: "Temporal progression" (if relevant)
    - Identify historical context needs
    - Generate time-filtered queries
    - Execute parallel time-period searches

  hop_4: "Causal chain" (if applicable)
    - Trace cause-effect relationships
    - Generate causal queries
    - Execute sequential causal analysis

  hop_5: "Gap filling" (exhaustive depth only)
    - Identify remaining information gaps
    - Generate targeted gap-filling queries
    - Execute focused searches
```

**Step 3.5: Evidence Collection & Verification**
```yaml
evidence_tracking:
  for each finding:
    - Record source (URL, title, author)
    - Calculate confidence score
    - Note supporting/conflicting sources
    - Tag verification status
    - Store in Serena evidence chain

contradiction_handling:
  when conflicts detected:
    - List all conflicting sources
    - Assess credibility of each
    - Seek additional tie-breaker sources
    - Present balanced view with confidence levels
```

### Phase 4: Synthesis & Reporting (20-25% effort)

**Step 4.1: Synthesis (Sequential MCP)**
```yaml
synthesis_process:
  - Aggregate findings across all sources
  - Identify convergent themes (agreement)
  - Resolve contradictions (or note inability)
  - Highlight high-confidence insights
  - Note gaps and uncertainties
  - Generate actionable recommendations
```

**Step 4.2: Report Generation**
```yaml
report_structure:
  - Executive Summary
  - Research Methodology
  - Key Findings (by theme)
  - Source Analysis
  - Confidence Assessment
  - Contradictions & Limitations
  - Recommendations
  - Full Source List
```

**Step 4.3: Evidence Storage (Serena)**
```yaml
serena_operations:
  - write_memory("research_[topic]_[timestamp]", full_evidence_chain)
  - write_memory("research_case_[id]", case_based_learning_data)
  - write_memory("research_patterns_[topic]", successful_patterns)
```

### Phase 5: Validation & Reflection (5-10% effort)

**Quality Checks**:
- Confidence threshold met? (≥0.7 for standard, ≥0.8 for deep)
- Sources diverse enough? (≥3 tier-1 or tier-2 sources)
- Contradictions addressed? (all conflicts noted or resolved)
- Gaps identified? (missing information explicitly stated)
- Evidence complete? (all claims have source backing)

**Self-Reflection Triggers**:
- Confidence below threshold → replan
- Insufficient sources → expand search
- High contradiction rate → seek more sources
- Time limit approaching → prioritize completion
