## Examples

### Example 1: Simple File Reading

```bash
/sc:select-tool "read authentication configuration"
```

**Output**:
```markdown
# Tool Recommendation: Read Authentication Configuration

## Primary Recommendation: Read Tool

**Rationale**:
- Simple file reading operation
- Known configuration file location
- No pattern matching required
- Low complexity, fast execution

**Usage**: `Read @config/auth.js`

**MCP Enhancement**: Not needed for this operation

**Anti-Pattern**: ❌ Using Grep when file path is known
```

### Example 2: Pattern Search

```bash
/sc:select-tool "find all API endpoint definitions"
```

**Output**:
```markdown
# Tool Recommendation: Find API Endpoints

## Primary Recommendation: Grep Tool

**Rationale**:
- Pattern-based search across codebase
- Unknown file locations
- Need to find all matches
- Efficient for text pattern matching

**Usage**: `Grep pattern="app\\.get|app\\.post" path=./`

**MCP Enhancement**:
- **Serena**: Store endpoint inventory in project memory
- **Sequential**: Analyze endpoint patterns and inconsistencies

**Anti-Pattern**: ❌ Reading files one-by-one → ✅ Pattern search
```

### Example 3: Complex Refactoring

```bash
/sc:select-tool "rename getUserData function across project"
```

**Output**:
```markdown
# Tool Recommendation: Rename Function Across Project

## Primary Recommendation: Serena MCP (Symbol Operations)

**Rationale**:
- Symbol-level operation requiring semantic understanding
- Need to track all references and usages
- Maintain code correctness through symbol tracking
- Cross-file dependency management

**Usage**:
```bash
# Via Serena MCP
find_symbol(name_path="getUserData")
→ Analyze all references
→ Safe rename with dependency tracking
```

**Alternative**: Morphllm (if simple text replacement sufficient)

**MCP Enhancement**: Serena is primary, not enhancement

**Anti-Pattern**: ❌ Manual search-replace → ✅ Symbol-aware refactoring
```

### Example 4: E2E Testing

```bash
/sc:select-tool "test user registration flow"
```

**Output**:
```markdown
# Tool Recommendation: Test User Registration

## Primary Recommendation: Puppeteer MCP

**Rationale**:
- Real browser interaction required
- User workflow simulation
- Form submission and validation
- Visual feedback important
- Shannon's primary testing MCP

**Usage**:
```bash
# Test workflow with Puppeteer
1. Navigate to registration page
2. Fill form fields
3. Submit form
4. Validate success state
5. Verify user in system
```

**MCP Enhancements**:
- **Serena**: Store test results and patterns
- **Sequential**: Test planning and scenario analysis

**Alternative**: Playwright (for cross-browser testing)

**Anti-Pattern**: ❌ Mocked testing → ✅ Real browser validation
```

### Example 5: Research Operation

/sc:select-tool "research React testing best practices 2024"
```

**Output**:
```markdown
# Tool Recommendation: Research React Testing

## Primary Recommendation: Tavily MCP

**Rationale**:
- Current information needed (2024)
- External knowledge required
- Multiple source aggregation
- Best practices discovery

**Usage**:
```bash
Tavily search: "React testing best practices 2024"
→ Aggregate multiple sources
→ Identify consensus patterns
→ Extract actionable recommendations
```

**MCP Enhancements**:
- **Sequential**: Synthesize findings into structured recommendations
- **Serena**: Store research findings in project memory
- **Context7**: Validate against official React documentation

**Anti-Pattern**: ❌ Outdated knowledge → ✅ Current research
```

## Integration with Shannon Commands

### With /sh:spec (Specification Analysis)

```bash
/sh:spec analyze @requirements.md --tool-suggestions
```

Shannon automatically suggests tools based on spec analysis:
- Serena for context preservation
- Sequential for complex analysis
- Context7 for framework patterns
- Puppeteer for testing requirements

### With /sc:analyze

```bash
/sc:analyze @codebase/ --suggest-tools
```

Provides tool recommendations for analysis tasks:
- Grep for pattern discovery
- Serena for symbol analysis
- Sequential for complex reasoning

### With /sc:implement

```bash
/sc:implement "feature" --tools auto-select
```

Automatically selects optimal tools:
- Magic for UI components
- Context7 for framework patterns
- Serena for context storage
- Puppeteer for testing

---

## Best Practices

### Tool Selection Principles

1. **Start Simple**: Use native tools for simple operations
2. **MCP for Complexity**: Graduate to MCPs when operations become complex
3. **Always Serena for Waves**: Mandatory memory integration in Wave operations
4. **Puppeteer for Testing**: Shannon's primary E2E testing MCP
5. **Context7 for Learning**: Official documentation for framework questions
6. **Sequential for Analysis**: Systematic reasoning for complex problems

### Performance Optimization

1. **Token Awareness**: Consider token costs of MCP operations
2. **Caching**: Leverage Serena caching for repeated operations
3. **Batch Operations**: Use MultiEdit for bulk changes when possible
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with native tools, add MCPs as needed

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Using Grep on single known file** → ✅ Use Read
❌ **Manual refactoring without Serena** → ✅ Use symbol operations
❌ **Mocked E2E tests** → ✅ Use Puppeteer for real validation
❌ **Ignoring Serena in Waves** → ✅ Always use for context preservation
❌ **Using Playwright instead of Puppeteer** → ✅ Puppeteer for Shannon projects

---

## Configuration & Settings

### MCP Server Availability Check

Command checks for installed and configured MCP servers:

```yaml
check_sequence:
  1. Read ~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json
  2. Identify configured MCP servers
  3. Test server availability
  4. Provide server-specific recommendations
  5. Warn about missing recommended servers
```

### Recommendation Tuning

Users can configure recommendation preferences:

```yaml
preferences:
  favor_native_tools: true          # Prefer native over MCP when equivalent
  token_optimization: true          # Consider token costs in recommendations
  performance_priority: moderate    # [low|moderate|high]
  learning_mode: false             # Show detailed explanations
```
