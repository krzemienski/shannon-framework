/sc:improve - Enhanced Code Improvement Command

> **Shannon V4 Skill-Based Framework**: Progressive disclosure command with linked skills

## Purpose

> **Shannon V3 Enhancement**: SuperClaude's `/improve` command enhanced with wave-based iterative improvement, mandatory test validation after each wave, quality metrics tracking, and REFACTORER + QA sub-agent coordination.

## Usage Patterns

**Basic Usage**:
```
/sc:improve [target]
/sc:improve src/auth/login.js
/sc:improve @components/UserProfile.tsx
/sc:improve "authentication module"
```

**With Focus Area**:
```
/sc:improve [target] --focus performance
/sc:improve [target] --focus security
/sc:improve [target] --focus maintainability
/sc:improve [target] --focus readability
```

**With Iteration Control**:
```
/sc:improve [target] --iterations 3
/sc:improve [target] --until-threshold
/sc:improve [target] --max-waves 5
```

**With Scope Control**:
```
/sc:improve [target] --scope file
/sc:improve [target] --scope module
/sc:improve [target] --scope system
```

**With Quality Thresholds**:
```
/sc:improve [target] --complexity-max 10
/sc:improve [target] --coverage-min 80
/sc:improve [target] --performance-budget 100ms
```
