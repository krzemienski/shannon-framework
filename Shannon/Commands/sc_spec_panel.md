# /sc:spec-panel - Enhanced Specification Review Panel

## Purpose Statement

Shannon V3 enhances SuperClaude's expert specification review with **automatic 8-dimensional complexity scoring**, **phase planning integration**, and **specification improvement pattern recognition**. The command provides multi-expert analysis while simultaneously calculating objective complexity metrics that inform downstream phase planning and wave orchestration.

## Shannon V3 Enhancements

### 1. Automatic 8-Dimensional Analysis Integration

When reviewing specifications, Shannon automatically calculates complexity scores across eight dimensions:

**Structural Complexity** (0.0-1.0):
- File count, service boundaries, module organization
- Triggers: Files >10, Services >3, Modules >5

**Cognitive Complexity** (0.0-1.0):
- Architectural decisions, design patterns, abstractions
- Triggers: Design decisions >5, Novel patterns >3

**Coordination Complexity** (0.0-1.0):
- Team dependencies, integration points, communication
- Triggers: Teams >2, Integrations >5, Stakeholders >4

**Temporal Complexity** (0.0-1.0):
- Timeline constraints, dependencies, critical paths
- Triggers: Phases >3, Dependencies >8, Tight deadlines

**Technical Complexity** (0.0-1.0):
- Technology stack diversity, learning curves, risks
- Triggers: Technologies >4, New tech >2, Integration risk

**Scale Complexity** (0.0-1.0):
- User volume, data scale, performance requirements
- Triggers: Users >10K, Data >1TB, High throughput

**Uncertainty Complexity** (0.0-1.0):
- Unknown requirements, changing scope, ambiguities
- Triggers: Unknowns >20%, Scope volatility, MVP uncertainties

**Dependency Complexity** (0.0-1.0):
- External dependencies, library integrations, API contracts
- Triggers: External deps >5, API contracts >3, Platform risks

### 2. Phase Planning Integration

Specifications reviewed by the panel automatically trigger **PHASE_PLANNING.md** patterns when:
- Overall complexity score >0.6
- Specification indicates multi-phase delivery
- Expert panel identifies planning opportunities

**Integration Flow**:
```
/sc:spec-panel @spec.yml
  ↓
Expert Panel Review + 8-Dimensional Analysis
  ↓
If complexity >0.6 OR multi-phase indicators detected:
  ↓
Suggest: /sc:code-to-spec OR direct phase planning
  ↓
Auto-populate phase templates with expert recommendations
```

### 3. Specification Improvement Pattern Recognition

Shannon tracks **recurring specification issues** and **improvement patterns** across reviews:

**Pattern Categories**:
- **Anti-patterns**: Common specification mistakes by domain
- **Best practices**: Proven improvement patterns by context
- **Quality heuristics**: Domain-specific quality indicators
- **Evolution patterns**: How specifications improve over iterations

**Pattern Storage**: Uses Serena MCP to build project-specific spec improvement knowledge base

### 4. Shannon SPEC_ANALYZER Agent Activation

For complex specifications (complexity >0.7), the command can delegate to the **SPEC_ANALYZER agent** for:
- Comprehensive requirements extraction
- Domain identification with percentages
- MCP server suggestions with rationale
- Validation gate recommendations

## Triggers

**Standard SuperClaude Triggers**:
- Specification quality review and improvement requests
- Technical documentation validation and enhancement needs
- Requirements analysis and completeness verification
- Professional specification writing guidance and mentoring

**Shannon Enhancement Triggers**:
- Specification complexity analysis before project kickoff
- Phase planning preparation from specification documents
- Specification-driven MCP server selection
- Pattern-based specification improvement workflows

## Analysis Modes (SuperClaude + Shannon)

### Discussion Mode (`--mode discussion`)
**SuperClaude**: Collaborative improvement through expert dialogue
**Shannon Addition**: Complexity metrics inform discussion priorities

**Enhanced Output**:
```
=== SHANNON COMPLEXITY CONTEXT ===
Overall Complexity: 0.53 (MODERATE)
Top Drivers: Cognitive (0.68), Technical (0.63), Dependency (0.59)
Phase Recommendation: 3-phase delivery

=== EXPERT PANEL DISCUSSION ===

KARL WIEGERS: "The requirement 'SHALL handle failures gracefully' lacks specificity.
Shannon's Uncertainty score of 0.46 indicates 15% of requirements need clarification."

MICHAEL NYGARD: "Building on Karl's point, Shannon identifies Dependency complexity
of 0.59 with 4 OAuth providers. We need specific failure modes for each provider."

MARTIN FOWLER: "The Cognitive complexity of 0.68 suggests architectural decisions
need documentation. How do we communicate token refresh to upstream services?"
```

### Critique Mode (`--mode critique`)
**SuperClaude**: Systematic review with improvement suggestions
**Shannon Addition**: Quantitative metrics support qualitative critique

**Enhanced Output**:
```
=== SHANNON COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS ===
Structural: 0.55 | Cognitive: 0.68 | Coordination: 0.42 | Temporal: 0.51
Technical: 0.63 | Scale: 0.38 | Uncertainty: 0.46 | Dependency: 0.59
Overall: 0.53 (MODERATE) → Recommended: 3-phase delivery

=== REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS ===

KARL WIEGERS - Requirements Quality Assessment:
❌ CRITICAL: Requirement R-001 lacks measurable acceptance criteria
📊 SHANNON CONTEXT: Contributes to Uncertainty 0.46 and Cognitive 0.68 scores
📝 RECOMMENDATION: Replace "handle failures gracefully" with specific thresholds
🎯 PRIORITY: High - Reduces Uncertainty by 0.12, Cognitive by 0.08
📈 IMPACT: Overall complexity reduction from 0.53 → 0.47

=== ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS ===

MARTIN FOWLER - Interface Design:
⚠️ MAJOR: Token refresh mechanism unclear
📊 SHANNON CONTEXT: Primary driver of Cognitive 0.68 score
📝 RECOMMENDATION: Specify refresh token lifecycle and rotation policy
🎯 PRIORITY: High - Reduces Cognitive by 0.15
📈 IMPACT: Enables Phase 2 parallel development (coordination benefit)
```

### Socratic Mode (`--mode socratic`)
**SuperClaude**: Learning-focused questioning
**Shannon Addition**: Complexity-guided question sequencing

**Enhanced Output**:
```
=== SHANNON LEARNING CONTEXT ===
Focus Areas Based on Complexity:
- Cognitive (0.68): Architecture decisions, security patterns
- Technical (0.63): Technology stack, OAuth2 implementation
- Uncertainty (0.46): Ambiguous requirements, TBD items

=== GUIDED INQUIRY ===

ALISTAIR COCKBURN: "Shannon identifies 7 service components. What is the fundamental
problem each component solves, and how do they relate to stakeholder goals?"

MARTIN FOWLER: "Cognitive complexity is 0.68 due to OAuth2 + JWT + session management.
What would happen if we simplified to OAuth2-only with no explicit session state?"

MICHAEL NYGARD: "Shannon shows Dependency complexity of 0.59 with 4 OAuth providers.
How do we handle provider failures without cascading the entire authentication system?"

KARL WIEGERS: "Uncertainty score of 0.46 indicates 15% TBD requirements. Which of
these unknowns are critical path blockers versus nice-to-have clarifications?"
```

## Integration Patterns

### Specification → Analysis → Phase Planning (Shannon Flow)

```bash
# Step 1: Comprehensive specification analysis
/sc:spec-panel @authentication_service.spec.yml --shannon-mode

# Output includes:
# - Expert panel recommendations
# - 8-dimensional complexity scores
# - Phase planning suggestions
# - MCP coordination recommendations

# Step 2: Automatic phase planning trigger (if complexity >0.6)
/sc:code-to-spec --from-analysis @spec_analysis_results.yml

# Or manual phase planning with context
/sc:workflow @authentication_service.spec.yml --use-complexity-analysis
```

### Pattern Learning Workflow (Shannon + Serena)

```bash
# Step 1: Analyze with pattern learning enabled
/sc:spec-panel @auth_spec.yml --learn-patterns

# Shannon captures:
# - Recurring issues in authentication domain
# - Proven improvements from expert panel
# - Complexity correlations with quality
# - Stored in Serena for future use

# Step 2: Future authentication specifications benefit from patterns
/sc:spec-panel @new_auth_spec.yml

# Shannon automatically:
# - Checks Serena for authentication patterns
# - Suggests proactive improvements
# - Flags common issues before expert review
```

### Multi-Agent Delegation for Complex Specs

```bash
# Complex specification triggers automatic delegation
/sc:spec-panel @enterprise_platform.spec.yml

# Shannon detects complexity >0.7 and delegates:
# - SPEC_ANALYZER agent for comprehensive analysis
# - Expert panel for qualitative review
# - Parallel execution with synthesis

# Results include:
# - Domain breakdown with percentages
# - Detailed complexity analysis
# - Expert recommendations
# - Phase planning templates
# - MCP coordination strategy
```

## Improvement Pattern Recognition

### Anti-Pattern Detection (Shannon Learning)

**Common Specification Anti-Patterns**:
```yaml
authentication_domain:
  - pattern: "timeout_unspecified"
    frequency: 0.78  # 78% of auth specs
    complexity_impact: +0.12 (Uncertainty)
    fix_template: "Specify session timeout with configurable values"

  - pattern: "error_handling_vague"
    frequency: 0.65
    complexity_impact: +0.15 (Cognitive + Uncertainty)
    fix_template: "Define specific failure scenarios with recovery actions"

  - pattern: "versioning_strategy_missing"
    frequency: 0.71
    complexity_impact: +0.14 (Technical + Dependency)
    fix_template: "Specify API versioning strategy and deprecation policy"
```

### Best Practice Patterns (Shannon Knowledge Base)

**Proven Improvement Patterns**:
```yaml
authentication_improvements:
  - pattern: "concrete_failure_scenarios"
    success_rate: 0.85

# Output:
# - Expert recommendations with priorities
# - Complexity report with dimension scores
# - Improvement impact predictions
# - MCP coordination suggestions
# - Phase planning templates (if applicable)
```

### Complexity-First Analysis (Shannon Mode)

```bash
/sc:spec-panel @complex_microservices.spec.yml --shannon-mode

# Prioritizes complexity analysis:
# 1. Calculate 8-dimensional scores first
# 2. Identify top complexity drivers
# 3. Select expert panel based on drivers
# 4. Focus expert review on complexity areas
# 5. Generate targeted improvement plan

# Use when: Large specifications, multi-domain systems, complexity unknown
```

### Delegated Comprehensive Analysis

```bash
/sc:spec-panel @enterprise_platform.spec.yml --delegate-analyzer

# Activates SPEC_ANALYZER agent:
# 1. Comprehensive requirements extraction
# 2. Domain identification with percentages
# 3. Detailed 8-dimensional analysis
# 4. MCP server recommendations
# 5. Validation gate suggestions
# 6. Expert panel synthesis

# Use when: Complexity >0.7, multi-domain specs, comprehensive analysis needed
```

### Pattern Learning Workflow

```bash
# Initial specification with pattern capture
/sc:spec-panel @new_api.spec.yml --learn-patterns

# Shannon learns:
# - Domain: REST API design
# - Recurring issues: versioning strategy missing, error codes undefined
# - Effective improvements: OpenAPI schema, error code taxonomy
# - Complexity correlation: Technical 0.62 → 0.48 after improvements

# Future specifications benefit:
/sc:spec-panel @another_api.spec.yml

# Shannon proactively suggests:
# - "Based on REST API patterns, consider specifying versioning strategy"
# - "Authentication specs typically benefit from error code taxonomy"
# - Shows: 72% of similar specs improved with these patterns
```
