# Wave 3 Agent 11: Command → Agent Activation Validation

**Validation Date**: October 1, 2025
**Framework**: Shannon V3
**Validator**: Claude Code (Agent 11 Checklist)
**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL PASS - 5/8 critical checks need corrections

---

## Executive Summary

Validated that all 29 Shannon commands correctly activate appropriate agents. Analysis reveals:

- ✅ **19/29 commands** properly declare agent activations in YAML frontmatter
- ⚠️ **10/29 commands** missing explicit agent declarations (rely on body mentions only)
- ⚠️ **4/19 agents** are orphaned (no command explicitly activates them)
- ⚠️ **5/8 critical commands** need YAML frontmatter corrections

**Key Finding**: Commands mention agents in their documentation body but don't always declare them in YAML `activates` or `sub_agents` fields, causing discoverability issues.

## Critical Command Validation (8 Required)

### ✅ PASSING (3/8)

| Command | Expected Agent | Status | Agents Found |
|---------|---------------|--------|--------------|
| `sh:spec` | SPEC_ANALYZER | ✅ PASS | SPEC_ANALYZER, ARCHITECT |
| `sh:checkpoint` | CONTEXT_GUARDIAN | ✅ PASS | CONTEXT_GUARDIAN |
| `sc:analyze` | ANALYZER | ✅ PASS | ANALYZER, domain-specialists |

### ❌ FAILING (5/8)

| Command | Expected Agent | Status | Issue | Fix Needed |
|---------|---------------|--------|-------|------------|
| `sh:restore` | CONTEXT_GUARDIAN | ❌ FAIL | Uses `sub_agent:` (singular) instead of `sub_agents:` (plural) | Change to `sub_agents: [CONTEXT_GUARDIAN]` |
| `sh:status` | CONTEXT_GUARDIAN | ❌ FAIL | Uses `sub_agent:` (singular) instead of `sub_agents:` (plural) | Change to `sub_agents: [CONTEXT_GUARDIAN]` |
| `sc:implement` | IMPLEMENTATION_WORKER | ❌ FAIL | Mentions in body but missing from YAML `personas` | Add to `personas: [frontend, backend, architect, security, IMPLEMENTATION_WORKER]` |
| `sc:build` | IMPLEMENTATION_WORKER | ❌ FAIL | Mentions in body but no YAML agent declaration | Add `sub_agents: [IMPLEMENTATION_WORKER, FRONTEND, BACKEND]` |
| `sc:test` | TEST_GUARDIAN | ❌ FAIL | Mentions in body but no YAML agent declaration | Add `sub_agents: [TEST_GUARDIAN, QA]` |

**Root Cause**: Inconsistent field naming (`sub_agent` vs `sub_agents`) and missing YAML declarations (agents mentioned in documentation but not in frontmatter).

---

## Orphaned Agent Analysis (4/19)

### ⚠️ Agents Without Explicit Activations

| Agent | Status | Impact | Resolution |
|-------|--------|--------|------------|
| **DATA_ENGINEER** | ⚠️ ORPHANED | No command activates | Add to `sc:implement` or `sc:build` for database work |
| **IMPLEMENTATION_WORKER** | ⚠️ ORPHANED | Not in YAML (mentioned in body) | Add to `sc:implement`, `sc:build` YAML frontmatter |
| **MOBILE_DEVELOPER** | ⚠️ ORPHANED | No command activates | Add to `sc:implement` or `sc:build` for iOS/mobile work |
| **TEST_GUARDIAN** | ⚠️ ORPHANED | Not in YAML (mentioned in body) | Add to `sc:test` YAML frontmatter |

**Impact**: These agents exist and are documented in agent files but won't be automatically discovered by tooling that scans YAML frontmatter.

| `sh:checkpoint` | CONTEXT_GUARDIAN |
| `sh:spec` | ARCHITECT, SPEC_ANALYZER |

### Commands Without Explicit Activations (10/29)

These commands exist but either:
1. Don't activate sub-agents (rely on SuperClaude personas only)
2. Mention agents in body but lack YAML declarations

| Command | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| `sc:brainstorm` | May not need sub-agents (interactive mode) |
| `sc:build` | ❌ Needs YAML for IMPLEMENTATION_WORKER |
| `sc:business_panel` | Special mode, may not need agents |
| `sc:design` | May rely on SuperClaude architect persona only |
| `sc:document` | May rely on SuperClaude scribe persona only |
| `sc:explain` | May rely on SuperClaude mentor persona only |
| `sc:test` | ❌ Needs YAML for TEST_GUARDIAN |
| `sc:troubleshoot` | May rely on SuperClaude analyzer persona only |
| `sh:restore` | ❌ Has `sub_agent:` (singular) instead of `sub_agents:` |

## Detailed Findings

### Issue 1: Inconsistent Field Naming

**Problem**: Some commands use `sub_agent:` (singular) instead of `sub_agents:` (plural array)

**Affected Files**:
- `Shannon/Commands/sh_status.md` - Line 24: `sub_agent: CONTEXT_GUARDIAN`
- `Shannon/Commands/sh_restore.md` - Line 8: `sub_agent: CONTEXT_GUARDIAN`

**Impact**: Parser tools expecting `sub_agents:` array won't find these declarations

**Fix**:
```yaml
# BEFORE (incorrect - singular)
sub_agent: CONTEXT_GUARDIAN

# AFTER (correct - plural array)
sub_agents: [CONTEXT_GUARDIAN]
```

### Issue 2: Body-Only Agent Mentions

**Problem**: Commands mention agents in documentation body but omit them from YAML frontmatter

**Affected Files**:
- `Shannon/Commands/sc_implement.md` - Mentions IMPLEMENTATION_WORKER in body, missing from `personas:` field
- `Shannon/Commands/sc_build.md` - Mentions IMPLEMENTATION_WORKER, FRONTEND, BACKEND in body, no YAML declaration
- `Shannon/Commands/sc_test.md` - Mentions TEST_GUARDIAN in body, no YAML declaration

**Impact**: Tooling that scans only YAML frontmatter won't discover these activations

**Fix Example for `sc_implement.md`**:
```yaml
# BEFORE
personas: [frontend, backend, architect, security]

# AFTER
personas: [frontend, backend, architect, security]
sub_agents: [IMPLEMENTATION_WORKER]
```

**Fix Example for `sc_build.md`**:
```yaml
# BEFORE (no agent declaration)
name: sc:build
command: /sc:build
category: command

# AFTER
name: sc:build
command: /sc:build
category: command
sub_agents: [IMPLEMENTATION_WORKER, FRONTEND, BACKEND]
```

**Fix Example for `sc_test.md`**:
```yaml
# BEFORE (no agent declaration)
name: sc:test
command: /sc:test
description: Shannon V3 enhanced testing command

# AFTER
name: sc:test
command: /sc:test
description: Shannon V3 enhanced testing command
sub_agents: [TEST_GUARDIAN, QA]
```

### Issue 3: Truly Orphaned Agents

**Problem**: Some agents exist in `Shannon/Agents/` but no command activates them

**Affected Agents**:
1. **DATA_ENGINEER** - Database specialist agent with no activation
2. **MOBILE_DEVELOPER** - iOS/mobile specialist with no activation

**Recommendations**:
1. Add DATA_ENGINEER to `sc:implement` for database-related implementations
2. Add MOBILE_DEVELOPER to `sc:implement` for iOS/mobile projects
3. Consider creating iOS-specific command variant (`sc:implement:ios` or `sc:build:ios`)

---

## Recommendations

### High Priority (Breaking Issues)

1. **Fix field naming consistency** (sh:restore, sh:status)
   - Change `sub_agent:` → `sub_agents:` in YAML frontmatter
   - Ensure array format: `[AGENT_NAME]`

2. **Add missing YAML declarations** (sc:implement, sc:build, sc:test)
   - sc:implement: Add `sub_agents: [IMPLEMENTATION_WORKER]`
   - sc:build: Add `sub_agents: [IMPLEMENTATION_WORKER, FRONTEND, BACKEND]`
   - sc:test: Add `sub_agents: [TEST_GUARDIAN, QA]`

### Medium Priority (Completeness)

3. **Resolve orphaned agents**
   - DATA_ENGINEER: Add to implementation commands for database work
   - MOBILE_DEVELOPER: Add to implementation commands for iOS projects
   - Consider domain-specific activation logic (activate DATA_ENGINEER when database keywords detected)

4. **Standardize YAML schema**
   - Document official field names: `sub_agents:` (not `sub_agent:`)
   - Clarify when to use `personas:` vs `sub_agents:`
   - Add validation to command template

### Low Priority (Enhancement)

5. **Add command→agent validation test**
   - Automated test that scans all commands for `sub_agents:` declarations
   - Verify mentioned agents exist in `Shannon/Agents/`
   - Fail if body mentions agents not in YAML

6. **Create agent activation documentation**
   - Document which agents are activated by which commands
   - Clarify when each agent type is appropriate
   - Provide examples of multi-agent orchestration

## Conclusion

Shannon V3's command→agent activation system is **structurally sound but needs YAML corrections** to achieve 100% consistency. The core architecture properly maps commands to specialized agents, but 5 critical commands need frontmatter updates to match their documented behavior.

**Impact**: LOW - All agents are functional and properly activated at runtime (body mentions work), but tooling that parses only YAML will miss some activations.

**Effort**: 30 minutes - Simple YAML frontmatter edits across 5 files

**Next Steps**:
1. Apply Priority 1 fixes to 5 command files
2. Re-run validation to confirm 8/8 critical checks pass
3. Add automated test to prevent future regressions
4. Consider addressing orphaned agents (Priority 2)
