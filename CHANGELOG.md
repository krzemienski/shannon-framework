## [3.0.1] - 2024-10-16

### Added

#### Enhanced Hook System (5 Hooks Total)

#### Infrastructure
- `.gitignore` for shannon-plugin/ to exclude Python cache and logs
- `IMPROVEMENTS_V3.0.1.md` documenting all 27 identified improvements
- `TEST_RESULTS_V3.0.1.md` with comprehensive validation results

### Changed

#### Hook System Improvements
- PreCompact hook timeout increased from 5s to 15s for large projects
- PreCompact hook now logs to structured .jsonl files

#### CLAUDE.md Transformation
- Converted from legacy @ reference system to plugin development guide
- Removed all broken Shannon/ directory references (now Shannon-legacy/)
- Added comprehensive development workflow documentation
- Clarified usage: plugin for users, CLAUDE.md for Shannon developers only

#### Error Handling
- PreCompact hook: Added structured error logging and warnings
- PreCompact hook: Better visibility with stderr messages
- PreCompact hook: Added plugin_root tracking to metadata

### Fixed

- PreCompact hook matcher removed (was invalid ".*" for non-tool hook)

- Plugin version consistency (now 3.0.1 throughout)

### Documentation

- Comprehensive improvement analysis via Context7 documentation review
- 27 improvements identified with implementation priorities

## Migration Notes

### v2.x → v3.0.0

**Required Actions**:
1. Remove Shannon @-references from CLAUDE.md
2. Install Shannon plugin via marketplace
3. Configure Serena MCP if not already configured
4. Verify installation with `/sh_status`

**No Code Changes**: Your projects and workflows remain unchanged. Only installation method changes.

**Checkpoint Compatibility**: v2.x checkpoints work with v3.0.0 (same Serena MCP format).

### v1.x → v3.0.0

Recommended: Upgrade to v2.0.0 first, then v3.0.0. Or follow v3.0.0 migration guide directly.
