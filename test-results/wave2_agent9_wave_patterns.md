## 5. Gaps and Recommendations

### Gap 1: WAVE_COORDINATOR Explicit Naming
**Affected Commands**: `/sc:analyze`, `/sc:build`, `/sc:design`, `/sc:troubleshoot`, `/sc:business-panel`
**Severity**: Medium
**Impact**: Documentation clarity

**Recommendation**:
```markdown
Add explicit WAVE_COORDINATOR mention in "Sub-Agent Integration" sections:

Example for /sc:analyze:
### WAVE_COORDINATOR (Wave Orchestrator)
**Role**: Coordinate parallel domain analysis across specialist agents
**Activation**: Automatic when system-wide analysis required
**Responsibilities**:
  - Spawn specialist agents in parallel (ARCHITECT, PERFORMANCE, SECURITY, QA)
  - Ensure context loading from Serena
  - Aggregate wave results
  - Synthesize cross-domain insights
```

### Gap 2: Wave Execution Examples
**Affected Commands**: `/sc:design`, `/sc:troubleshoot`, `/sc:business-panel`
**Severity**: Low
**Impact**: Learning and understanding

**Recommendation**:
Add detailed wave execution examples showing:
1. Wave-by-wave progression
2. Context sharing between waves
3. Parallel agent spawning
4. Synthesis and aggregation

### Gap 3: Performance Expectations
**Status**: Generally good across all commands
**Enhancement Opportunity**: Add wave-specific performance metrics

**Recommendation**:
```yaml
wave_performance:
  wave_1: "< 2 minutes (discovery/planning)"
  wave_2: "< 5 minutes (parallel execution, 3-5 agents)"
  wave_3: "< 1 minute (synthesis)"
  total: "< 10 minutes for 3-wave operation"

parallelization_gain:
  sequential: "12 hours (sum of agent times)"
  parallel: "5 hours (max of agent times)"
  speedup: "2.4x faster"
```

### Gap 4: Wave-to-WAVE_ORCHESTRATION.md Cross-References
**Status**: Most commands reference wave orchestration conceptually
**Enhancement Opportunity**: Add explicit cross-references

**Recommendation**:
Add section to each wave-enabled command:
```markdown
## Integration with WAVE_ORCHESTRATION.md

See [WAVE_ORCHESTRATION.md](../Core/WAVE_ORCHESTRATION.md) for:
- Wave execution architecture
- Parallel spawning patterns
- Context handoff protocols
- Wave completion criteria
- Performance optimization strategies

This command implements:
- [Wave Pattern Name]: [Brief description]
- [Coordination Strategy]: [Brief description]
```

## 9. Conclusion

### Validation Outcome
✅ **PASS** - All 6 wave-enabled commands properly document wave orchestration patterns.

**Strengths**:
1. **Universal Serena Integration**: All commands leverage Serena MCP for cross-wave context
2. **Consistent Phase Patterns**: All commands follow similar wave progression
3. **Parallel Execution**: Clear parallel strategies across all commands
4. **Sub-Agent Coordination**: Well-documented agent spawning and coordination
5. **Wave Synthesis**: All commands aggregate and synthesize wave results

**Areas for Improvement**:
1. **WAVE_COORDINATOR Naming**: Only 1/6 commands explicitly name it
2. **Wave Examples**: Some commands need more detailed wave execution examples
3. **Performance Metrics**: Wave-specific performance expectations could be more explicit

**Overall Assessment**: Shannon's wave-enabled commands demonstrate strong wave orchestration documentation with minor gaps that can be easily addressed. The framework is production-ready for wave-based execution.
