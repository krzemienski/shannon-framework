**Process**:
1. Query server registry for online status
2. Check circuit breaker states
3. Verify connection health
4. Measure response latencies
5. Update capability matrix

**Decision Logic**:
- All servers available → Proceed with optimal selection
- Some servers unavailable → Activate fallback chains
- Critical server down → Defer task or use degraded mode
- All servers down → Native-only execution

**Example**:
Task: "Analyze React component architecture"
Check: Magic (available), Context7 (available), Sequential (available)
Decision: Proceed with Magic + Context7 coordination
```

### Capability Query
```markdown
**Instruction**: Determine which server can best handle specific capability requirements

**Query Parameters**:
- Operation type (analysis, generation, transformation)
- Domain (frontend, backend, testing, refactoring)
- Complexity score (0.0-1.0)
- Latency requirements (critical, standard, relaxed)
- Token sensitivity (high, medium, low)
- Parallelization needs (required, preferred, not needed)

**Query Process**:
1. Extract task features (domain, complexity, requirements)
2. Score each server against requirements
3. Apply capability matrix weights
4. Consider server health and load
5. Return ranked server list

**Example**:
Query: "Complex debugging scenario, backend domain, high complexity"
Scoring: Sequential (0.95), Serena (0.82), Context7 (0.65)

## Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Single Server Operations
```markdown
**When to Use**: Simple, focused tasks within single domain

**Selection Criteria**:
- Task complexity: 0.3-0.6
- Single clear domain
- No cross-domain dependencies
- Latency not critical

**Integration Flow**:
1. Identify optimal server via capability matrix
2. Check cache for similar operations
3. Execute on selected server
4. Cache result with appropriate TTL
5. Monitor and record metrics

**Example**:
Task: "Get React hooks documentation"
Server: Context7 (documentation lookup)
Cache: Check docs cache (7200s TTL)
Result: Return cached or fetch fresh
```

### Pattern 2: Sequential Server Coordination
```markdown
**When to Use**: Multi-stage operations with clear dependencies

**Selection Criteria**:
- Task requires multiple stages
- Each stage has clear inputs/outputs
- Dependencies between stages
- Order matters for correctness

**Integration Flow**:
1. Decompose task into sequential stages
2. Map each stage to optimal server
3. Execute stages in dependency order
4. Pass outputs as inputs to next stage
5. Aggregate final result

**Example**:
Task: "Analyze and refactor authentication code"
Stage 1: Serena (understand current implementation)
Stage 2: Sequential (analyze security implications)
Stage 3: Context7 (find best practice patterns)
Stage 4: Morphllm (apply refactoring patterns)
Result: Analyzed and refactored code
```

### Pattern 3: Parallel Server Execution
```markdown
**When to Use**: Independent operations that can run concurrently

**Selection Criteria**:
- Multiple independent subtasks
- No cross-dependencies
- Time-sensitive operation
- Servers are parallelizable

**Integration Flow**:
1. Identify independent subtasks
2. Map each to optimal server
3. Launch parallel executions
4. Set timeout thresholds
5. Gather and combine results

**Example**:
Task: "Comprehensive frontend audit"
Parallel 1: Magic (UI component analysis)
Parallel 2: Context7 (framework patterns check)
Parallel 3: Playwright (accessibility validation)
Result: Combined audit report (3x speedup)
```

### Pattern 4: Fallback Chain Execution
```markdown
**When to Use**: Reliability critical, server availability uncertain

**Selection Criteria**:
- High-stakes operation
- Server failure possible
- Multiple capability alternatives
- Graceful degradation acceptable

**Integration Flow**:
1. Attempt primary server execution
2. Monitor for timeout or failure
3. Trigger circuit breaker if needed
4. Fall back to next server in chain
5. Continue until success or exhaustion

**Example**:
Task: "Document component API"
Primary: Context7 (official patterns)
Fallback 1: Memory (cached patterns)
Fallback 2: WebSearch (online docs)
Fallback 3: Native generation
Result: Documentation from first successful source
```

### Pattern 5: Hybrid Native-MCP Integration
```markdown
**When to Use**: Combine native capabilities with MCP expertise

**Selection Criteria**:
- Task requires both basic and specialized ops
- Some operations too simple for MCP
- Cost-efficiency important
- Mixed complexity levels

**Integration Flow**:
1. Partition task into simple and complex operations
2. Handle simple operations natively
3. Delegate complex operations to MCPs
4. Coordinate between native and MCP results
5. Synthesize unified output

**Example**:
Task: "Refactor component with style updates"
Native: Basic code reading and file operations
MCP (Serena): Semantic symbol understanding
MCP (Morphllm): Pattern-based transformations
Result: Efficient hybrid execution
```

## Server Selection Logic

### Fast Selection Algorithm (<10ms)

**Step 1: Feature Extraction (2ms)**
```markdown
Extract task features in parallel:
- Pattern matching (domain keywords)
- Complexity indicators (file count, lines, depth)
- Performance requirements (latency, tokens)
- Domain classification (frontend, backend, etc.)

Result: Fixed-size feature vector (64 dimensions)
```

**Step 2: Cache Lookup (1ms)**
```markdown
Generate fast hash of request:
- Include task type, domain, complexity
- Query pattern cache (LRU, 1000 entries)
- Return cached selection if found (45% hit rate)

Result: Cached server selection or proceed to scoring
```

**Step 3: SIMD Scoring (5ms)**
```markdown
Score all servers simultaneously:
- Vectorized matrix multiplication
- Weight matrix × feature vector
- Apply sigmoid activation
- Normalize scores to 0-1 range

Result: Score for each MCP server
```

**Step 4: Selection and Validation (2ms)**
```markdown
Select best server and validate:
- Choose highest scoring server
- Check circuit breaker status
- Verify server availability
- Cache selection for reuse

Result: Optimal MCP server with confidence score
```

### Decision Tree Structure

```markdown
Task → Extract Features → Cache Lookup?
                              ↓ Yes → Return Cached
                              ↓ No
                         Score Servers → Select Best
                              ↓
                    Check Circuit Breaker → Open?
                              ↓ Yes → Use Fallback
                              ↓ No
                       Verify Availability → Available?
                              ↓ Yes → Execute
                              ↓ No → Fallback Chain
```

### Confidence Scoring

**High Confidence (0.8-1.0)**:
- Clear domain match
- Strong capability alignment
- Historical success on similar tasks
- Server health excellent

**Moderate Confidence (0.6-0.8)**:
- Partial domain match
- Adequate capabilities
- Some historical success
- Server health good

**Low Confidence (0.4-0.6)**:
- Weak domain match
- Marginal capabilities
- Limited historical data
- Server health uncertain

**Very Low Confidence (<0.4)**:
- Poor domain match
- Insufficient capabilities
- Historical failures
- Consider fallback immediately

---

## Fallback Strategies

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

**Purpose**: Prevent cascading failures when servers experience issues

**State Transitions**:
```markdown
Closed (Normal) → 5 failures → Open (Blocking)
Open → 60s timeout → Half-Open (Testing)
Half-Open → 1 success → Closed
Half-Open → 1 failure → Open
```

**Behavioral Rules**:
1. Closed state: Allow all requests, count failures
2. Open state: Block requests, use fallback, wait timeout
3. Half-Open state: Allow one test request
4. Reset failure count on any success

**Example**:
```markdown
Sequential server experiencing issues:
Attempt 1: Timeout (count: 1)
Attempt 2: Error (count: 2)
Attempt 3: Timeout (count: 3)
Attempt 4: Error (count: 4)
Attempt 5: Timeout (count: 5) → Circuit OPEN
Result: Immediate fallback for next 60s
After 60s: Test request → Success → Circuit CLOSED
```

### Fallback Chain Definitions
