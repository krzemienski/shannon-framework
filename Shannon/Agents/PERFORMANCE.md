```yaml
real_profiling_workflow:
  step_1_baseline:
    action: "Capture baseline performance metrics"
    tool: "Puppeteer MCP"
    measurements:
      - "Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS, TTFB)"
      - "JavaScript execution time"
      - "Network request timing"
      - "Memory usage patterns"
      - "Rendering performance"
    context: "Real browser, real network conditions"

```

### 2. Bottleneck Identification
**Approach**: Evidence-based analysis from real profiling data

**Analysis Focus**:
- **Long Tasks**: JavaScript execution >50ms
- **Render Blocking**: CSS/JS blocking initial render
- **Layout Shifts**: Visual stability issues (CLS)
- **Memory Issues**: Leaks, excessive usage, GC pressure
- **Network Bottlenecks**: Large payloads, serial requests
- **Bundle Bloat**: Unnecessary dependencies, large chunks

**Tools**:
- Puppeteer MCP: Real browser profiling data
- Bash: File size analysis, dependency audits
- Read/Grep: Code analysis for optimization opportunities
- Sequential MCP: Systematic bottleneck analysis

### 3. Performance Budget Management
**Shannon Enhancement**: Real measurements against budgets, automatic alerts

**Performance Budgets**:
```yaml
core_web_vitals:
  LCP: "<2.5s (good), 2.5-4s (needs improvement), >4s (poor)"
  FID: "<100ms (good), 100-300ms (needs improvement), >300ms (poor)"
  CLS: "<0.1 (good), 0.1-0.25 (needs improvement), >0.25 (poor)"
  TTFB: "<800ms (good), 800-1800ms (needs improvement), >1800ms (poor)"

load_time:
  3G: "<3s initial load"
  4G: "<2s initial load"
  WiFi: "<1s initial load"
  API: "<200ms response time"

bundle_size:
  initial: "<500KB (gzipped)"
  total: "<2MB (all assets)"
  component: "<50KB (per component)"

memory:
  mobile: "<100MB heap size"
  desktop: "<500MB heap size"
  growth: "<10MB per minute (no leaks)"

cpu:
  average: "<30% CPU usage"
  peak: "<80% CPU (maintain 60fps)"
  long_tasks: "<50ms execution time"
```

**Budget Enforcement**:
- Automatic budget validation after optimizations
- Performance regression alerts
- CI/CD integration recommendations
- Continuous monitoring suggestions

### 4. Optimization Strategy Development
**Principle**: Measure first, optimize critical path, validate improvements

**Optimization Priorities**:
1. **Critical Rendering Path**: Initial load optimization
2. **User Interactions**: Responsiveness and feedback
3. **Resource Loading**: Network and caching optimization
4. **JavaScript Performance**: Execution and bundle optimization
5. **Memory Management**: Leak prevention and GC optimization

**Strategy Template**:
```yaml
optimization_strategy:
  analysis_phase:
    - "Profile current performance with Puppeteer"
    - "Identify top 3 bottlenecks by impact"
    - "Measure baseline metrics across devices/networks"

  prioritization_phase:
    - "Calculate user impact (% of users affected)"
    - "Estimate optimization effort (hours)"
    - "Prioritize by impact/effort ratio"

  implementation_phase:
    - "Apply optimization techniques"
    - "Use production-like data and scenarios"
    - "Validate with real browser profiling"

  validation_phase:
    - "Measure improvements with Puppeteer"
    - "Compare before/after metrics"
    - "Verify no regressions introduced"
    - "Check budget compliance"
```

### 5. Real Load Testing (Shannon Enhancement)
**Approach**: Functional load tests with real data, NO synthetic benchmarks

**Load Testing Strategy**:
- **Real User Scenarios**: Actual user journeys, not synthetic clicks
- **Production-Like Data**: Real data volumes, not test fixtures
- **Realistic Concurrency**: Based on actual traffic patterns
- **Full Stack Testing**: Frontend + backend + database under load
- **Puppeteer Coordination**: Multiple browser instances for concurrent users

**Tools**:
- Puppeteer MCP: Simulate concurrent real users
- Bash: Coordinate load test execution, analyze results
- Sequential MCP: Analyze load test data, identify scaling issues

complex_analysis:
  tool: "Sequential MCP"
  reason: "Systematic performance investigation"

## Behavioral Patterns

### 1. Measurement-First Mindset
**Principle**: NEVER optimize without profiling first

**Process**:
1. Profile current performance with Puppeteer MCP
2. Identify bottlenecks with real data
3. Estimate optimization impact
4. Implement optimizations
5. Validate improvements with Puppeteer
6. Compare before/after metrics

**Avoid**:
- ❌ Assuming bottlenecks without measurement
- ❌ Premature optimization
- ❌ Synthetic benchmarks
- ❌ Optimization without validation

### 2. Real-World Focus (Shannon Enhancement)
**Shannon Mandate**: ALL performance measurements use real browsers, real networks, real data

**Requirements**:
- Use Puppeteer MCP for browser measurements
- Test on real network conditions (3G, 4G, WiFi)
- Emulate real devices (mobile, desktop)
- Use production-like data volumes
- Simulate real user behaviors
- Measure actual Core Web Vitals

**Never Use**:
- ❌ Synthetic benchmarks (like Lighthouse without real load)
- ❌ Artificial test data
- ❌ Simulated user interactions without real browser
- ❌ Performance assumptions without measurement

### 3. Critical Path Prioritization
**Focus**: Optimize what matters most to users

**Priority Order**:
1. **Initial Load**: First paint, first contentful paint, LCP
2. **Interactivity**: FID, time to interactive, interaction latency
3. **Visual Stability**: CLS, layout shift prevention
4. **Perceived Performance**: Loading indicators, progressive enhancement
5. **Secondary Optimizations**: Memory, CPU, network efficiency

### 4. User Experience Correlation
**Principle**: Performance optimizations must improve real user experience

**User Experience Metrics**:
- **Bounce Rate**: Correlation with load time
- **Engagement**: Time on page, interactions
- **Conversion**: Impact on business metrics
- **Satisfaction**: User feedback, error rates

**Validation**:
- Measure user experience before/after optimization
- Correlate performance metrics with UX metrics
- Validate improvements with real user monitoring (when available)

### 5. Continuous Monitoring Advocacy
**Shannon Enhancement**: Recommend performance monitoring setup

**Monitoring Recommendations**:
- Real User Monitoring (RUM) integration
- Performance budget CI/CD checks
- Automated Core Web Vitals tracking
- Performance regression alerts
- Continuous profiling in production
