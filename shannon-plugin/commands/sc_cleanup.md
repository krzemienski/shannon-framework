```

### 2. Test Validation Framework

**Mandatory Testing Workflow**:
```
1. Pre-Cleanup Baseline
   ├─ Run test suite → Record baseline status
   ├─ Capture test output → Store in Serena
   └─ Calculate coverage → Baseline coverage metrics

2. Cleanup Execution
   ├─ Apply cleanup pattern → Incremental changes
   ├─ Track modifications → File-by-file change log
   └─ Create checkpoint → Rollback point if needed

3. Post-Cleanup Validation
   ├─ Run test suite → Compare against baseline
   ├─ Verify all tests pass → No regressions introduced
   ├─ Check coverage maintained → Coverage should not decrease
   └─ Generate validation report → Success/failure with evidence

4. Quality Gates
   ├─ All tests must pass → Blocking requirement
   ├─ No new warnings/errors → Quality regression check
   ├─ Coverage maintained → Baseline or improved
   └─ Manual review for medium+ risk → Human validation gate
```

**Test Validation Enforcement**:
- **Blocking**: Cleanup fails if tests don't pass post-cleanup
- **Evidence-Based**: All test results captured and stored
- **Rollback**: Automatic rollback if validation fails
- **Reporting**: Clear success/failure reporting with test evidence

### 3. Context Preservation via Serena

**Cleanup Memory Structure**:
```yaml
cleanup_session:
  session_id: "cleanup_[timestamp]_[scope_hash]"
  scope: "target files/directories"
  patterns_applied: ["pattern1", "pattern2"]

  pre_cleanup_state:
    files_modified: []
    test_status: "passing|failing"
    test_output: "baseline test results"
    coverage: "baseline coverage %"

  cleanup_operations:
    - pattern: "pattern_name"
      files: ["file1", "file2"]
      changes: "description of changes"
      risk_level: "low|medium|high"

  post_cleanup_state:
    test_status: "passing|failing"
    test_output: "validation test results"
    coverage: "post-cleanup coverage %"
    validation: "success|failure"

  quality_metrics:
    files_touched: 15
    lines_removed: 247
    complexity_reduced: "12%"
    warnings_eliminated: 8

  lessons_learned:
    what_worked: []
    challenges: []
    recommendations: []
```

**Serena Integration**:
- Store cleanup session history for future reference
- Track successful patterns for reuse
- Preserve rollback points for recovery
- Enable cross-session cleanup learning

### 4. Safe Multi-File Cleanup

**Incremental Change Strategy**:
```yaml
batch_processing:
  strategy: "process files in small batches"
  batch_size: 5-10 files per iteration
  validation: "run tests after each batch"
  rollback: "revert batch if validation fails"

risk_based_ordering:
  low_risk_first: "formatting, imports, comments"
  medium_risk_second: "naming, simple refactoring"
  high_risk_last: "structural changes, complexity reduction"

checkpoint_strategy:
  frequency: "after each batch"
  storage: "Serena memory + git commits"
  rollback: "automated on validation failure"
```

---

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Clean up specific file
/sc:cleanup @src/utils/helpers.ts

# Clean up directory
/sc:cleanup @src/components/

# Clean up entire project with specific patterns
/sc:cleanup --patterns "dead_code,imports,formatting"

# Clean up with specific risk tolerance
/sc:cleanup @src/ --max-risk medium
```

### Advanced Usage

```bash
# Cleanup with explicit test command
/sc:cleanup @src/ --test-command "npm test"

# Cleanup with coverage threshold
/sc:cleanup @src/ --maintain-coverage 80

# Cleanup with dry-run mode
/sc:cleanup @src/ --dry-run

# Cleanup with auto-commit on success
/sc:cleanup @src/ --auto-commit "chore: cleanup src directory"

# Cleanup specific patterns only
/sc:cleanup @src/ --patterns "console_logs,dead_code" --exclude-patterns "complexity"
```

### Wave Integration

```bash
# Although cleanup is not wave-enabled, it can be part of wave workflows
# Example: cleanup phase in improvement wave
/sc:improve @src/ --wave-mode
# Wave 2: Cleanup dead code (automatic /sc:cleanup invocation)
```

## Execution Flow

### Phase 1: Discovery and Planning

**1.1 Target Identification**
```
Input: File path or directory scope
↓
Scan target scope:
├─ Identify all files in scope
├─ Determine file types (JS/TS/PY/etc)
├─ Calculate scope size (file count, LOC)
└─ Assess complexity level
```

**1.2 Pattern Detection**
```
For each cleanup pattern:
├─ Run pattern detection (Grep, Sequential)
├─ Identify opportunities (count, locations)
├─ Assess risk level (low/medium/high)
└─ Estimate impact (lines affected, files touched)

Output: Cleanup opportunity report
```

**1.3 Test Discovery**
```
Identify test suite:
├─ Detect test framework (Jest, pytest, etc)
├─ Find test command (package.json, Makefile)
├─ Locate test files (convention-based search)
└─ Verify test environment
```

**1.4 Cleanup Plan Generation**
```
Create cleanup plan:
├─ Selected patterns (auto or manual)
├─ File batches (grouped by risk/dependency)
├─ Validation gates (test checkpoints)
├─ Rollback strategy (checkpoint creation)
└─ Estimated time (based on scope + testing)

Present plan to user for confirmation
```

### Phase 2: Pre-Cleanup Baseline

**2.1 Baseline Test Execution**
```
Run test suite:
├─ Execute test command
├─ Capture output (stdout, stderr)
├─ Parse test results (pass/fail counts)
└─ Record baseline status

Store in Serena: pre_cleanup_test_baseline
```

**2.2 Baseline Quality Metrics**
```
Collect metrics:
├─ Test coverage % (if available)
├─ Linter warnings/errors count
├─ Type checking errors (if applicable)
├─ Code complexity metrics
└─ File/line counts

Store in Serena: pre_cleanup_quality_metrics
```

**2.3 Checkpoint Creation**
```
Create rollback point:
├─ Git commit current state (if in repo)
├─ Serena snapshot of file contents
└─ Record checkpoint ID for recovery
```

### Phase 3: Cleanup Execution

**3.1 Pattern Application Loop**
```
For each cleanup pattern in plan:
  ├─ Load pattern definition
  ├─ Identify target files for this pattern
  ├─ Group files into batches (5-10 files)
  │
  └─ For each batch:
      ├─ Apply cleanup changes (Edit/MultiEdit)
      ├─ Run quick validation (syntax check)
      ├─ Run test suite (if checkpoint reached)
      ├─ Validate results (tests pass?)
      │   ├─ Success: Continue to next batch
      │   └─ Failure: Rollback batch + report error
      └─ Create checkpoint (after successful validation)
```

**3.2 Change Tracking**
```
For each modification:
├─ Record file path
├─ Record line changes (added/removed)
├─ Record pattern applied
├─ Track cumulative impact
└─ Store in Serena memory
```

**3.3 Risk Management**
```
Risk-based execution order:
1. Very Low Risk (imports, formatting, comments)
   └─ Test validation: Every 10 files

2. Low Risk (console logs, dead code detection)
   └─ Test validation: Every 5 files

3. Medium Risk (naming, simple refactoring)
   └─ Test validation: Every 3 files

4. High Risk (complexity reduction, structural)
   └─ Test validation: After each file
```

### Phase 4: Post-Cleanup Validation

**4.1 Full Test Suite Execution**
```
Run complete test suite:
├─ Execute same test command as baseline
├─ Capture output (stdout, stderr)
├─ Parse test results (pass/fail counts)
└─ Compare against baseline

Validation Rule: All tests that passed before must still pass
```

**4.2 Quality Metrics Comparison**
```
Compare against baseline:
├─ Test coverage (must maintain or improve)
├─ Linter warnings (should decrease)
├─ Type errors (should maintain or improve)
├─ Complexity metrics (should improve)
└─ Generate comparison report
```

**4.3 Validation Decision**
```
Success Criteria:
✓ All baseline tests still pass
✓ No new test failures introduced
✓ Coverage maintained or improved
✓ No new linter errors
✓ No new type errors

Failure: Rollback to checkpoint + report issues
Success: Proceed to finalization
```

### Phase 5: Finalization and Reporting

**5.1 Serena Memory Update**
```
Store cleanup session:
├─ Session metadata (timestamp, scope, patterns)
├─ Pre/post test results
├─ Quality metric improvements
├─ Files modified + change details
├─ Lessons learned
└─ Recommendations for future cleanups
```

## Integration Points

### SuperClaude Framework

**Persona Activation**:
- Primary: `refactorer` (code quality specialist)
- Secondary: `qa` (test validation)
- Support: `analyzer` (pattern detection)

**MCP Coordination**:
- Serena: Context preservation and cleanup history
- Sequential: Complex pattern detection and analysis
- Context7: Cleanup best practices and patterns

**Rules Compliance**:
- File Organization: Proper cleanup of temporary files
- Quality Standards: Enforce quality improvements
- Evidence-Based: All cleanup justified by metrics
- Validation Required: Mandatory test execution

### Wave System

**Not Wave-Enabled**: Cleanup is typically focused, scoped operation
**Wave Integration**: Can be invoked as part of larger wave workflows
**Example**: Improvement wave may include cleanup phase

### Shannon V3 Workflows

**Typical Usage Sequences**:
```
1. /sc:analyze → identify cleanup opportunities
2. /sc:cleanup → systematic cleanup execution
3. /sc:test → comprehensive validation

Or as part of improvement cycle:
1. /sc:improve --wave-mode
   → Wave 2: Cleanup (automatic /sc:cleanup)
```

---

## Quality Standards

### Test Validation Requirements

**Mandatory**:
- ✓ All baseline tests must pass post-cleanup
- ✓ No new test failures introduced
- ✓ Coverage must be maintained or improved
- ✓ Test execution within 10% of baseline time

**Recommended**:
- Test suite execution < 5 minutes (for rapid iteration)
- Coverage improvement goal: +2-5%
- Flaky test detection and reporting

### Risk Tolerance

**Very Low Risk**: No test validation between files (batch of 10)
**Low Risk**: Test validation every 5 files
**Medium Risk**: Test validation every 3 files
**High Risk**: Test validation after each file

### Quality Metrics

**Success Criteria**:
- Lines removed > 0
- Maintainability index improved
- Linter warnings decreased
- Test coverage maintained
- No new bugs introduced

---

## Error Handling

### Common Failure Scenarios

**Test Failures Post-Cleanup**:
```
Action: Automatic rollback to last checkpoint
Report: Failed cleanup batch + test output
User Action: Review test failures, adjust cleanup scope
```

**Coverage Regression**:
```
Action: Warn user, request manual review
Options: Proceed with warning OR rollback
User Action: Investigate coverage loss, add tests if needed
```

**Linter Errors Introduced**:
```
Action: Automatic rollback to last checkpoint
Report: Linter errors + affected files
User Action: Review cleanup pattern, adjust application
```

**Git Conflict on Commit**:
```
Action: Leave changes uncommitted
Report: Conflict details + resolution steps
User Action: Resolve conflicts manually, commit when ready
```

### Recovery Mechanisms

**Checkpoint Rollback**:
- Serena memory restoration
- Git reset to checkpoint commit (if applicable)
- File content restoration from snapshot

**Partial Success Handling**:
- Complete successful batches remain applied
- Failed batch rolled back
- Report indicates partial completion + next steps

---

## Performance Considerations

**Execution Time Estimation**:
```
Small cleanup (1-5 files): 2-4 minutes
Medium cleanup (5-20 files): 5-12 minutes
Large cleanup (20-50 files): 15-30 minutes
Very large cleanup (50+ files): 30+ minutes
```

**Optimization Strategies**:
- Batch processing reduces test execution overhead
- Risk-based ordering frontloads quick wins
- Incremental validation enables early failure detection
- Parallel pattern detection (multiple Grep calls)

**Resource Usage**:
- Test execution typically dominates execution time
- Serena memory storage: ~1-5MB per cleanup session
- Git checkpoint storage: Minimal (delta compression)

---

## Best Practices

### When to Use /sc:cleanup

**Good Candidates**:
- After major feature completion (cleanup technical debt)
- Before code reviews (improve code quality)
- Regular maintenance (quarterly cleanup cycles)
- After dependency updates (cleanup deprecated patterns)
- When linter warnings accumulate
- When test suite slows down (remove dead test code)

**Poor Candidates**:
- During active feature development (wait for stability)
- Without test suite (too risky without validation)
- On unfamiliar codebase (understand first)
- Under time pressure (cleanup requires validation time)

### Preparation Checklist

✓ Test suite exists and passes
✓ Baseline coverage known
✓ Git repository clean (or willing to checkpoint)
✓ Time allocated for validation (plan for 2x estimated time)
✓ Scope clearly defined (file/directory boundaries)
✓ Risk tolerance assessed (what patterns are safe?)

### Post-Cleanup Actions

✓ Review cleanup report for completeness
✓ Commit changes with detailed message
✓ Update documentation if structure changed
✓ Share improvements with team (knowledge transfer)
✓ Schedule next cleanup cycle (proactive maintenance)
