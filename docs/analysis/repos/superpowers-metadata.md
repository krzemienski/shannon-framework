## Analysis Purpose

Superpowers is the plan/execute framework reference. Analysis will focus on:
- write-plan command implementation
- execute-plan command implementation
- Plan structure and format
- Spec-to-plan conversion patterns
- Plan execution engine
- Iterative refinement approaches
- Large prompt handling strategies

Most recent commits (2025-11-06) suggest active development and current patterns.

Ready for Phase 4 deep analysis with 12 agents (plan/execute focus).
