2. **BACKEND** - API development + database + V4 patterns  
3. **MOBILE_DEVELOPER** - iOS/Android + V4 patterns
4. **DEVOPS** - CI/CD + infrastructure + V4 patterns
5. **SECURITY** - Security auditing + V4 patterns
6. **QA** - Quality assurance + enhanced NO MOCKS + V4 patterns
7. **PERFORMANCE** - Performance optimization + V4 patterns
8. **DATA_ENGINEER** - Data pipelines (covers DATA_SCIENTIST) + V4 patterns
9. **ARCHITECT** - System architecture (covers SYSTEM_ARCHITECT) + V4 patterns

---

## Agents Created (5 new)

1. **DATABASE_ARCHITECT** - Database schema, migrations, query optimization
2. **PRODUCT_MANAGER** - Product strategy, PRDs, feature prioritization
3. **TECHNICAL_WRITER** - Technical docs, API docs, developer guides
4. **API_DESIGNER** - RESTful/GraphQL API design, OpenAPI specs
5. **CODE_REVIEWER** - Code quality, reviews, best practices

## V4 Enhancements Applied

### 1. MANDATORY CONTEXT LOADING PROTOCOL
- Structured Serena MCP context loading before tasks
- Complete project history for every agent
- Zero information loss between waves

### 2. SITREP REPORTING PROTOCOL  
- Military-style status reporting (🟢🟡🔴 codes)
- Quantitative progress tracking (0-100%)
- 30-minute update intervals during waves
- Structured handoff authorization codes

### 3. Wave Coordination
- Load ALL previous wave contexts
- Save deliverables to Serena
- Coordinate with parallel agents
- Request handoff approval before completion

### 4. Frontmatter Enhancements
- `shannon-version: ">=4.0.0"`
- `mcp_servers.mandatory: [serena]`
- `depends_on: [spec-analyzer, phase-planner]`
- Enhanced capabilities arrays
