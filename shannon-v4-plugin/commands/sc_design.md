/sc:design - Shannon V3 Enhanced Design Command

> **Shannon V4 Skill-Based Framework**: Progressive disclosure command with linked skills

## Purpose

## Purpose Statement

**Base Function** (SuperClaude): Orchestrate system architecture design, component specifications, and technical planning.

**Shannon V3 Enhancements**:
- **Phase 2 Integration**: Automatic alignment with Phase Planning validation gates
- **Architecture Decision Records**: Persistent tracking via Serena MCP
- **Cross-Wave Context**: Design decisions accessible to all subsequent waves
- **Template Library**: Pre-structured design document templates
- **Validation Automation**: Checklist-driven approval gates
- **MCP Coordination**: Context7 for patterns, Sequential for analysis, Serena for persistence

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Usage
```bash
/sc:design [domain] [scope] [flags]
```

**Domains**:
- `system` - Full system architecture (microservices, data flow, component interaction)
- `api` - API contracts and endpoint specifications (REST, GraphQL, WebSocket)
- `database` - Schema design and data modeling (tables, relationships, indexes)
- `frontend` - UI component hierarchy and state management
- `backend` - Service architecture and business logic organization
- `infrastructure` - Deployment, scaling, and operational design

**Scopes**:
- `high-level` - Architecture overview and major component relationships
- `detailed` - Complete specifications with implementation guidance
- `component` - Single component or subsystem design
