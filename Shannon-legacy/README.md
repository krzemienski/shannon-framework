# Shannon Legacy Directory

⚠️ **DEPRECATED**: This directory contains the legacy CLAUDE.md-based Shannon Framework implementation.

## Status

**Active Version**: Shannon v3.0.0 Plugin (in `shannon-plugin/` directory)

**This Directory**: Legacy v2.x implementation for reference only

**Do Not Use**: This CLAUDE.md-based system is no longer maintained

## Migration

If you're still using the legacy Shannon system, please migrate to the plugin version:

1. **See Migration Guide**: [docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](../docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
2. **Install Plugin**: Follow [docs/PLUGIN_INSTALL.md](../docs/PLUGIN_INSTALL.md)
3. **Verify Installation**: Run `/sh_status` in Claude Code

## Why This Directory Exists

This directory is preserved for:
- **Reference**: Understanding Shannon's evolution
- **Comparison**: Seeing differences between v2.x and v3.0.0
- **Rollback**: Emergency fallback during migration (though unnecessary)
- **History**: Git history and development context

## Will This Be Removed?

This directory will likely be removed in a future release (v3.1.0 or later) after the plugin version is stable and widely adopted.

Until then, it remains for reference but should not be used for active Shannon installations.
