# Phase 1: Shannon Framework Research Findings

**Research Method**: Sequential file reading of cloned repository
**Files Read**: plugin.json, README.md, SPEC_ANALYSIS.md, WAVE_ORCHESTRATION.md, TESTING_PHILOSOPHY.md
**Component Counts**: 36 commands, 24 agents, 17 skills, 8 core docs

## Key Architecture

**4-Layer Design:**
1. Commands (user interface)
2. Skills (business logic)
3. Agents (specialized execution)
4. Tools/MCPs (primitives)

**Core Capabilities:**
- 8D complexity analysis (unique quantitative framework)
- Wave orchestration (parallel execution, 3.5x speedup)
- NO MOCKS testing (functional testing mandate)
- Serena MCP integration (context preservation)

**Unique Features:**
- Objective complexity scoring
- True parallelism via wave spawning
- Zero tolerance for mocks
- Checkpoint/restore system

**Status**: Production ready v4.0.0, zero community adoption

**Next**: Research SuperClaude to compare
