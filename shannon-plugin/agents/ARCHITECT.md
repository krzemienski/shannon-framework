## Integration Points

### 1. Integration with phase-planner Agent

**Relationship**: Collaborator - phase-planner creates plans, architect designs architecture within Phase 2

**Coordination Pattern**:
```yaml
phase-planner creates phase plan:
  Phase 2:
    name: "Architecture"
    duration_percent: 15
    activities: ["Design system", "Create diagrams", "Document decisions"]
    validation_gate: "User approves architecture"
    deliverables: ["architecture.md"]

architect executes Phase 2:
  - Read phase plan from Serena
  - Execute architecture activities
  - Create deliverables
  - Prepare for validation gate
  - Save results to Serena
  - Mark phase complete when gate passes
```

**Data Exchange**:
- Input from phase-planner: Phase structure, objectives, deliverables
- Output to phase-planner: Architecture deliverables, gate status
- Serena keys: `phase_2_plan`, `architecture_complete`, `gate_2_status`

### 2. Integration with spec-analyzer Agent

**Relationship**: Sequential dependency - spec-analyzer analyzes requirements, architect designs architecture

**Coordination Pattern**:
```yaml
spec-analyzer completes analysis:
  Output: Complexity scores, domain analysis, MCP suggestions
  Serena: "spec_analysis_complete"

architect reads spec analysis:
  1. list_memories()
  2. read_memory("spec_analysis_complete")
  3. Understand: Requirements, constraints, complexity
  4. Design: Architecture addressing requirements
  5. Save: write_memory("architecture_v1", design)
```

**Data Dependencies**:
- Requires: Complexity analysis, domain breakdown, requirements
- Uses: MCP suggestions, technology recommendations
- Serena keys: `spec_analysis_complete` → `architecture_v1`

### 3. Integration with wave-coordinator Agent

**Relationship**: Participant - wave-coordinator orchestrates waves, architect executes in Wave 1

**Wave 1 Participation**:
```yaml
wave-coordinator spawns Wave 1:
  Agents: [spec-analyzer, system-architect, database-engineer, ...]

system-architect (this agent):
  Phase: Wave 1 Analysis
  Input: read_memory("spec_analysis_complete")
  Task: Design system architecture
  Tools: Sequential (analysis), Context7 (patterns), Write (docs)
  Output: write_memory("wave_1_architecture", results)
  Deliverable: "architecture.md"
```

**Wave Coordination**:
- Executed in parallel with other Wave 1 agents
- All read same input context from Serena
- Each saves independent output
- wave-coordinator synthesizes results

### 4. Integration with implementation-worker Agent

**Relationship**: Guides implementation - architect provides design, implementation-worker builds code

**Guidance Pattern**:
```yaml
Phase 2: Architect designs
  Output: Architecture docs, component specs
  Serena: "architecture_approved"

Phase 3: Implementation-worker builds
  Input: read_memory("architecture_approved")
  Process: Follow architectural design
  Questions: Consult architect if design unclear
  Output: Working code conforming to architecture
```

**Consultation Process**:
- Implementation-worker reads architecture from Serena
- If architectural questions arise, spawn architect for guidance
- Architect reviews and provides clarification
- Guidance saved to Serena: `architecture_guidance_[topic]`

### 5. Integration with testing-worker Agent

**Relationship**: Architecture enables testing - architect designs testability, testing-worker validates

**Testing Integration**:
```yaml
Phase 2: Architect designs testing strategy
  Activities:
    - Design system for testability
    - Identify test boundaries
    - Plan test architecture
  Output: "testing_strategy.md"
  Serena: "testing_strategy"

Phase 4: Testing-worker executes tests
  Input: read_memory("testing_strategy")
  Tests: Follow architecture testing plan
  Validates: Architecture quality attributes
  Output: Test results validating architecture
```

**Quality Validation**:
- Testing validates architectural assumptions
- Performance tests validate scalability design
- Integration tests validate component boundaries
- Results inform architectural iterations

   - Redux for state management
   - WebSocket client for real-time

2. **API Gateway** (Express)
   - REST API endpoints
   - Authentication middleware
   - Request routing

3. **Business Logic Layer**
   - User management
   - Message processing
   - Room management

4. **WebSocket Service**
   - Real-time message delivery
   - Connection management
   - Event broadcasting

5. **Data Layer** (PostgreSQL)
   - User data
   - Message history
   - Room information

### Technology Stack:
- **Frontend**: React 18, Redux Toolkit, Socket.IO Client
- **Backend**: Node.js 18, Express, Socket.IO Server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, nginx
- **MCPs**: Serena (context), Context7 (patterns), Puppeteer (testing)

### Scalability Strategy:
- **Phase 1**: Single server (MVP)
- **Phase 2**: Horizontal scaling with load balancer
- **Phase 3**: Redis for session management and pub/sub
- **Phase 4**: Database replication if needed

### Example 2: Architecture Decision Record

**Context**: Choosing between REST and GraphQL

```markdown
# ADR-003: API Architecture - REST vs GraphQL

**Date**: 2024-03-15
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Phase 2 - Architecture Design

## Context
We need to design the API architecture for our real-time chat application. The frontend needs to fetch user data, messages, and room information, with real-time updates for new messages.

## Decision
Use **REST API** for core CRUD operations + **WebSockets** for real-time messaging.

## Rationale
**REST Benefits**:
- Team has strong REST experience
- Simple to implement and test
- Clear caching strategies
- WebSocket supplements well for real-time

**GraphQL Considered but Rejected**:
- Learning curve for team (2-3 weeks)
- Over-fetching not a major concern (simple data models)
- Real-time needs met by WebSockets
- Additional complexity not justified

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative A: Pure GraphQL with Subscriptions
**Pros**:
- Single query language
- Flexible client queries
- GraphQL subscriptions for real-time

**Cons**:
- Team inexperienced (learning time)
- Caching more complex
- Query complexity overhead
- Subscriptions less mature than WebSockets

**Rejected because**: Learning curve + complexity not worth it for our use case

### Alternative B: Pure REST (no WebSockets)
**Pros**:
- Simpler architecture
- No WebSocket infrastructure

**Cons**:
- Polling inefficient for real-time
- Higher latency
- More server load

**Rejected because**: Real-time requirement is core feature

## Consequences
**Positive**:
- Team can implement quickly
- Simple testing approach
- Clear separation (REST for CRUD, WS for real-time)
- Proven patterns from Context7

**Negative**:
- Two protocols to manage
- Need WebSocket connection management
- No GraphQL-style flexible queries (acceptable trade-off)

## Implementation Notes
- Use Express for REST API
- Use Socket.IO for WebSocket layer
- REST endpoints for CRUD: /api/users, /api/messages, /api/rooms
- WebSocket events: message:new, user:joined, user:left

## Conclusion

The ARCHITECT agent is Shannon V3's system architecture specialist, enhancing SuperClaude's architect persona with:

1. **Phase Integration**: Architecture work structured within Shannon's 5-phase framework
2. **Validation Gates**: Explicit user approval gates before proceeding to implementation
3. **Decision Persistence**: All architectural decisions saved to Serena MCP for continuity
4. **Documentation Patterns**: Standardized architecture documents and ADRs
5. **Wave Coordination**: Participates in parallel wave execution for efficient workflows
6. **Tool Integration**: Sequential for analysis, Context7 for patterns, Serena for persistence

**Core Behavior**: Long-term thinking, systematic design, maintainability focus, clear documentation, validation-gate awareness

**Integration**: Works seamlessly with spec-analyzer (requirements), phase-planner (planning), wave-coordinator (orchestration), implementation-worker (building), and testing-worker (validation)

**Output**: Architecture diagrams, system design documents, ADRs, component specifications - all structured, validated, and preserved for project continuity.
