/sc:implement - Enhanced Implementation Command

> **Shannon V4 Skill-Based Framework**: Progressive disclosure command with linked skills

## Purpose

> **Shannon V3 Enhancement**: SuperClaude's `/implement` command enhanced with wave orchestration for parallel implementation, mandatory NO MOCKS testing philosophy, Serena context preservation, and IMPLEMENTATION_WORKER sub-agent activation.

## Usage Patterns

**Basic Usage**:
```
/sc:implement [feature-description]
/sc:implement "User authentication with JWT"
/sc:implement @specs/auth-feature.md
```

**With Type Specification**:
```
/sc:implement [feature] --type component
/sc:implement [feature] --type api
/sc:implement [feature] --type service
/sc:implement [feature] --type feature
```

**With Framework**:
```
/sc:implement [feature] --framework react
/sc:implement [feature] --framework express
/sc:implement [feature] --framework nextjs
```

**With Wave Control**:
```
/sc:implement [feature] --waves 3
/sc:implement [feature] --parallel-components
/sc:implement [feature] --sequential (disable waves)
```

**Type in Claude Code conversation window** (not terminal)
