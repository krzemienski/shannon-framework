# System-Critical Skills Analysis

**Phase -1, Task -1.3: Deep Analysis of 3 System-Critical Skills**

---

## Overview

Three skills are system-critical for Shannon V4 enhancement plan execution:
1. **testing-skills-with-subagents** (387 lines)
2. **writing-skills** (622 lines)
3. **skill-creator** (209 lines)

All three have been read completely during session-context-priming.

## Skill 1: testing-skills-with-subagents

**Lines**: 387
**Purpose**: TDD for process documentation - validate skills work under pressure

**Invocation Syntax**:
```python
Skill("testing-skills-with-subagents")
```

**When to Invoke in This Project**:
- Phase 10: Functional testing of all enhancement designs
- Validating that enhancement specifications are bulletproof
- Testing skill documentation with pressure scenarios

**Input Requirements**:
- Test scenarios (3+ combined pressures for discipline skills)
- Baseline behavior documentation
- Success criteria

**Output**:
- Baseline test results (RED phase)
- Compliance verification (GREEN phase)
- Loophole identification and plugging (REFACTOR)

**Key Pattern**: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle for documentation

## Skill 2: writing-skills

**Lines**: 622
**Purpose**: Create effective skills using TDD methodology

**Invocation Syntax**:
```python
Skill("writing-skills")
```

**When to Invoke in This Project**:
- ALL deliverable creation (MANDATORY per plan line 2)
- 700-page functional specification
- Architecture documentation
- Pattern library documentation
- Any structured writing task

**Input Requirements**:
- Content requirements (what needs to be written)
- Target audience
- Structure requirements (if specified)
- Quality requirements

**Output**:
- Complete deliverable following TDD for documentation
- Tested and validated content
- Bulletproof against rationalization

**Key Pattern**: No deliverable without proper structure, CSO optimization, TDD validation

## Skill 3: skill-creator

**Lines**: 209
**Purpose**: Guide for creating effective skills with specialized knowledge

**Invocation Syntax**:
```python
Skill("skill-creator")
```

**When to Invoke in This Project**:
- Phase 8: Creating new Shannon enhancement skills
- Developing 40+ skill examples
- Creating skills for forced reading, SITREP, etc.

**Input Requirements**:
- Skill purpose
- Concrete usage examples
- Required resources (scripts/references/assets)

**Output**:
- Complete skill directory
- Validated SKILL.md
- Packaged .zip file

**Key Pattern**: 6-step process (Understanding → Planning → Init → Edit → Package → Iterate)

## Invocation Strategy for Shannon V4 Enhancement Plan

### Phase -1 (Current)
- No skill invocations needed (inventory and analysis only)

### Phases 1-7 (Research & Design)
- **writing-skills**: When creating analysis documents (if needed for rigor)

### Phase 8 (Deliverables)
- **writing-skills**: MANDATORY for 700-page functional spec
- **skill-creator**: MANDATORY for creating enhancement skill examples

### Phase 10 (Testing)
- **testing-skills-with-subagents**: MANDATORY for functional testing

---

**Task -1.3 Complete**: System skills understood and invocation strategy documented.
