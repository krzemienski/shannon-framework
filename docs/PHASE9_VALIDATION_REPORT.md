## Recommendations

**Before Implementation:**
1. ✅ Review all specifications with stakeholders
2. ✅ Prioritize enhancements (already done: 1-4 HIGH, 5-10 MEDIUM/LOW)
3. ✅ Allocate resources (timeline defined: 12-16 weeks)
4. ✅ Set up validation infrastructure

**During Implementation:**
1. Follow phased approach (Technical → Content → Community)
2. Validate each enhancement independently
3. Measure success metrics continuously
4. Adjust based on community feedback

**Post-Implementation:**
1. Monitor adoption metrics
2. Iterate based on usage patterns
3. Expand community infrastructure
4. Plan V4.2.0 enhancements
