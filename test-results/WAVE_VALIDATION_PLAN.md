# Shannon Framework Wave-Based Validation Plan

**Plan ID**: WAVE-VAL-001
**Date Created**: 2025-10-01
**Purpose**: Validate Shannon Framework using wave-based sub-agent orchestration
**Total Waves**: 4
**Total Agents**: 14 (5+4+4+1)
**Estimated Duration**: 13 minutes

---

## Strategy Overview

**Approach**: Use Shannon's own wave orchestration principles to validate Shannon itself

**Key Principle**: We cannot execute Shannon commands within this session (we ARE Claude Code). Instead, agents validate Shannon's CONTENT and STRUCTURE to ensure it will work when deployed.

**Wave Structure**:
- **Wave 1**: Core File Validation (5 agents in parallel)
- **Wave 2**: Behavioral Pattern Validation (4 agents in parallel)
- **Wave 3**: Integration Validation (4 agents in parallel)
- **Wave 4**: Synthesis & Reporting (1 agent)

**Execution**: All agents in each wave spawn in ONE message (true parallelism)

## Execution Notes

**Key Principles**:

- Sequential waves (wait for wave completion before next)
- Evidence-based validation (no speculation)
- Actionable findings (every issue has recommended fix)
- Performance-conscious (respect 13-minute target)

**Context Management**:
- Wave 1: Highest token usage (5 detailed validations)
- Wave 2: Moderate token usage (pattern analysis)
- Wave 3: Moderate token usage (integration testing)
- Wave 4: Synthesis reuses previous wave outputs

**Quality Assurance**:
- Each agent follows 15-point checklist
- All findings require evidence
- Cross-validation between agents
- Synthesis agent validates consistency

**Success Measurement**:
- Quantitative: Completion percentages, gap counts
- Qualitative: Framework coherence, documentation clarity
- Actionable: Clear remediation paths for all issues
