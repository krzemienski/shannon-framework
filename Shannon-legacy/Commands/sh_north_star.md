# Mid-development drift detection
User: "Should we also add a payment system?"
Response: /sh:north-star check "Add payment system"
‚Üí Alignment: 0.15 (MISALIGNED)
‚Üí Warning: Scope creep detected

# Goal evolution
User: "Requirements changed - need to support SSO"
Response: /sh:north-star "Build enterprise auth with JWT, OAuth, and SSO"
‚Üí Goal updated with rationale

## North Star Actions

### SET - Establish Goal

**Purpose**: Define the guiding objective for all operations

**Goal Quality Criteria**:
```yaml
goal_characteristics:
  clear_and_specific:
    ‚úÖ "Build JWT authentication with refresh tokens"
    ‚ùå "Make auth better"
  
  measurable_outcomes:
    ‚úÖ "Achieve <100ms token validation"
    ‚ùå "Fast performance"
  
  time_bounded:
    ‚úÖ "Launch MVP auth by end of sprint"
    ‚ö†Ô∏è  "Eventually have auth" (acceptable if long-term)
  
  achievable:
    ‚úÖ "Add rate limiting to existing auth"
    ‚ùå "Build AI-powered quantum blockchain auth"
  
  aligned_with_intent:
    ‚úÖ Reflects user's actual request
    ‚ùå Interpreted differently than intended
```

**Example**:
```bash
/sh:north-star "Build secure authentication system with <100ms response time"

# Output:
üéØ NORTH STAR GOAL SET
‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ

**Goal**: Build secure authentication system with <100ms response time

**Quality Assessment**:
‚úÖ Clear and specific (authentication system defined)
‚úÖ Measurable (<100ms performance target)
‚ö†Ô∏è  Time-bounded (no explicit deadline - acceptable for now)
‚úÖ Achievable (realistic technical goal)
‚úÖ Aligned (matches user intent)

**Overall Quality**: üü¢ HIGH (4/5 criteria strong)

üíæ Saved to: Serena memory + ~/.claude/shannon/north_star.txt

üß≠ All subsequent operations will be evaluated against this goal
```

### GET - Retrieve Current Goal

**Purpose**: Display active North Star goal and metrics

**Example**:
```bash
/sh:north-star

# Output:
üéØ CURRENT NORTH STAR GOAL
‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ

**Goal**: Build secure authentication system with <100ms response time

**Set**: 2025-10-03 12:00:00 (4 hours ago)
**Status**: ‚úÖ ACTIVE

**Recent Aligned Operations** (Last 10):
1. ‚úÖ Implemented JWT token generation (Alignment: 1.0)
2. ‚úÖ Added token validation middleware (Alignment: 1.0)
3. ‚úÖ Optimized database queries (Alignment: 0.9)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Added user profile features (Alignment: 0.4)
5. ‚úÖ Implemented rate limiting (Alignment: 0.95)

**Overall Alignment**: 0.85 (Good)

**Drift Warnings**: 1 operation below 0.5 threshold (#4)
```

### CHECK - Alignment Verification

**Purpose**: Verify if proposed operation aligns with goal

**Alignment Scoring**:
```yaml
scoring_rubric:
  direct_alignment: 1.0
    - Core functionality for goal
    - Essential requirement
    Example: "Add JWT validation" for "Build JWT auth" = 1.0
  
  partial_alignment: 0.5-0.9
    - Supports goal but not core
    - Enhances primary functionality
    Example: "Add password strength meter" = 0.7
  
  indirect_support: 0.2-0.5
    - Tangentially related
    - Nice-to-have feature
    Example: "Improve UI animations" = 0.3
  
  misalignment: <0.2
    - Scope creep
    - Unrelated feature
    - Goal drift
    Example: "Add payment processing" = 0.1
```

**Example**:
```bash
/sh:north-star check "Add OAuth social login"

# Output:
üß≠ ALIGNMENT CHECK
‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ

**Operation**: Add OAuth social login
**North Star**: Build secure authentication system with <100ms response time

**Alignment Analysis**:
üìä Score: 0.85 (Strong alignment)

**Rationale**:
‚úÖ Direct support: OAuth is authentication mechanism
‚úÖ Security: Leverages provider security (Google, GitHub)
‚ö†Ô∏è  Performance: May add latency (external API calls)
‚úÖ Scope: Within authentication system boundaries

**Recommendation**: ‚úÖ PROCEED
Operation strongly aligns with North Star goal

**Considerations**:
- Monitor OAuth response times (keep <100ms budget)
- Implement caching for provider data
- Add fallback if OAuth providers slow
```

### HISTORY - Goal Evolution

**Purpose**: Show how North Star has evolved

**Example**:
```bash
/sh:north-star history

# Output:
üìú NORTH STAR HISTORY
‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ

**Current Goal** (Active):
"Build secure authentication with <100ms response time"
Set: 2025-10-03 12:00:00
Duration: 4 hours
Operations: 23 aligned

**Previous Goals**:

1. "Build basic authentication" (Replaced)
   Set: 2025-10-03 08:00:00
   Duration: 2 hours
   Reason for change: "Performance requirement added"
   Impact: Expanded scope, added optimization focus

2. "Create user login system" (Replaced)
   Set: 2025-10-02 14:00:00
   Duration: 6 hours
   Reason for change: "Clarified security requirements"
   Impact: Added security emphasis, broader scope

**Evolution Insights**:
- Goals becoming more specific (good)
- Performance focus added (strategic improvement)
- Scope expanding gradually (monitor for creep)
```

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Activate NORTH_STAR_KEEPER

**Sub-Agent Activation**:
```python
# Activate goal management specialist
activate_agent("NORTH_STAR_KEEPER")

# Agent characteristics:
# - Strategic alignment assessor
# - Scope creep detector
# - Goal evolution tracker
# - Decision guidance provider
```

### Step 2: Parse Action

**Action Router**:
```python
action = detect_action(command)

if no_arguments:
    action = "get"
elif is_goal_statement(arguments):
    action = "set"
elif arguments.startswith("check"):
    action = "check"
elif arguments == "history":
    action = "history"

params = extract_parameters(arguments, action)
```

### Step 3: Execute Action

**Action-Specific Logic**:
```python
if action == "set":
    # Validate goal quality
    quality = assess_goal_quality(params["goal"])
    if quality["score"] < 0.6:
        warn_user("Goal quality below threshold")
    
    # Store goal
    store_goal(params["goal"])
    create_entities([{
        "name": "north_star_goal",
        "entityType": "Goal",
        "observations": [params["goal"]]
    }])

elif action == "check":
    # Calculate alignment
    alignment = calculate_alignment(
        operation=params["operation"],
        goal=current_goal
    )
    
    # Provide guidance
    if alignment < 0.2:
        recommendation = "STOP - Misaligned"
    elif alignment < 0.5:
        recommendation = "RECONSIDER - Low alignment"
    elif alignment < 0.8:
        recommendation = "PROCEED with caution"
    else:
        recommendation = "PROCEED - Strong alignment"
```

- ‚úÖ Goals are clear and measurable
- ‚úÖ Alignment scoring is accurate
- ‚úÖ Drift is detected early
- ‚úÖ Decisions guided by goal
- ‚úÖ Goal evolution tracked
- ‚úÖ Scope boundaries enforced

**North Star management fails if**:
- ‚ùå Goals too vague to guide decisions
- ‚ùå Alignment scoring inconsistent
- ‚ùå Scope creep not detected
