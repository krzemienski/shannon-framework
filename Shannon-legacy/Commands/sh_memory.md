## Memory Actions

### TRACK - Entity Evolution Tracking

**Purpose**: Monitor how specific entities evolve over time

**What It Monitors**:
```yaml
evolution_metrics:
  observation_accumulation:
    - Rate of new observations
    - Observation quality over time
    - Content diversity
  
  relationship_formation:
    - New relationships created
    - Relationship strength changes
    - Network position evolution
  
  context_building:
    - How entity contributes to understanding
    - Usage in different contexts
    - Cross-entity references
  
  access_frequency:
    - How often entity is accessed
    - Access patterns (when and why)
    - Usage efficiency
```

**Example**:
```bash
/sh:memory track authentication

# Output:
📊 ENTITY EVOLUTION: authentication
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Timeline**:
Day 1: Entity created with 3 observations
Day 2: +5 observations, 2 relationships added
Day 3: +12 observations, 4 relationships added (Current)

**Observations** (20 total):
- Early (1-5): Basic requirements and design decisions
- Middle (6-15): Implementation details and challenges
- Recent (16-20): Performance optimization, security hardening

**Relationships** (6 total):
- implements → jwt_service
- requires → user_database
- coordinates_with → session_manager
- validates_via → token_validator
- integrates_with → oauth_provider
- monitored_by → security_scanner

**Access Patterns**:
- Total accesses: 47
- Peak: Phase 2 implementation (23 accesses)
- Recent: 5 accesses this session
- Efficiency: 0.76 (good reuse)

**Health**: ✅ Healthy evolution (balanced growth)
```

### PATTERN - Memory Usage Analysis

**Purpose**: Analyze overall memory coordination patterns

**What It Analyzes**:
```yaml
pattern_dimensions:
  entity_clustering:
    - How entities group together
    - Community detection
    - Cluster strength
  
  relationship_distribution:
    - Types of relationships used
    - Relationship density
    - Network topology
  
  access_patterns:
    - Sequential access chains
    - Parallel access patterns
    - Hot/cold entity distribution
  
  evolution_trajectories:
    - Growth patterns over time
    - Maturation indicators
    - Stagnation detection
```

**Example**:
```bash
/sh:memory pattern

# Output:
📈 MEMORY PATTERN ANALYSIS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Entity Clustering**:
Cluster 1: Authentication (8 entities) - Dense, well-connected
Cluster 2: Database (5 entities) - Moderate connectivity  
Cluster 3: UI Components (12 entities) - Sparse connections
Orphans: 3 entities with no relationships

**Relationship Distribution**:
- implements: 23 (32%)
- requires: 18 (25%)
- coordinates_with: 15 (21%)
- validates_via: 8 (11%)
- integrates_with: 8 (11%)

**Access Patterns**:
🔥 Hot entities (>20 accesses): authentication, user, database
❄️  Cold entities (<5 accesses): legacy_payment, old_session
📊 Access distribution: 80/20 rule (20% entities = 80% accesses)

**Evolution Trajectories**:
📈 Growing: authentication (+15 obs/day), api_gateway (+8/day)
➡️  Stable: database (±2 obs/day)
📉 Declining: legacy_session (-3 obs/day, candidate for pruning)

**Coordination Effectiveness**: 0.78 (Good)
```

```

### OPTIMIZE - Optimization Recommendations

**Purpose**: Identify and suggest memory improvements

**Optimization Types**:
```yaml
redundancy_elimination:
  - Merge similar entities
  - Consolidate duplicate observations
  - Remove unnecessary relationships

relationship_strengthening:
  - Add missing critical relationships
  - Improve relationship types
  - Create shortcuts for frequent paths

observation_pruning:
  - Remove stale observations
  - Archive historical data
  - Focus on recent/relevant

access_pattern_improvement:
  - Optimize frequent access paths
  - Pre-load commonly used clusters
  - Cache hot entities
```

**Example**:
```bash
/sh:memory optimize

# Output:
💡 MEMORY OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**High Impact** 🔴:
1. **Merge Redundant Entities**
   - "user_auth" + "authentication" → Single "authentication" entity
   - Impact: Reduce confusion, improve access efficiency
   - Effort: Low (automated merge)

2. **Add Critical Relationship**
   - authentication →[validates_via]→ rate_limiter (MISSING)
   - Impact: Complete security context
   - Effort: Low (single relationship)

**Medium Impact** 🟡:
3. **Prune Stale Observations**
   - "legacy_payment" has 45 observations, 40 are >30 days old
   - Impact: Reduce noise, focus on relevant
   - Effort: Low (automated pruning with review)

4. **Create Access Shortcut**
   - Current: auth → user → profile → display (4 hops)
   - Optimize: auth → display (direct relationship)
   - Impact: Faster navigation, reduced token usage

**Low Impact** 🟢:
5. **Archive Cold Entities**
   - 3 entities with <2 accesses in 30 days
   - Impact: Cleaner graph, minimal performance gain

**Estimated Gains**:
- Coordination score: 0.78 → 0.88 (+13%)
- Access efficiency: 0.71 → 0.82 (+15%)
- Token usage: -10% (reduced graph traversal)
```

### STATS - Memory Statistics

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Graph Size**:
- Total Entities: 42

**Growth Metrics**:
- Entities added (7 days): +12 (1.7/day)
- Relations added (7 days): +23 (3.3/day)
- Observations added (7 days): +89 (12.7/day)

**Access Distribution**:
- Hot entities (>20 accesses): 4 (9.5%)
- Warm entities (10-20): 8 (19%)
- Cool entities (5-10): 12 (28.6%)
- Cold entities (<5): 18 (42.9%)

**Coordination Score**: 0.78
- Access efficiency: 0.81
- Pattern consistency: 0.76
- Evolution coherence: 0.77

**Health Status**: ✅ HEALTHY
- Entity/relation ratio: 0.54 (optimal: 0.4-0.6)
- Observation freshness: 87% within 7 days
- Access distribution: Following 80/20 rule
- Evolution consistency: Steady growth
