2. Context (Objective, Scope, Dependencies)
3. Findings (Key discoveries and results)
4. Issues (Blockers, Risks, Questions)
5. Next Steps (Action items)
6. Artifacts (Generated files/documents)
7. Validation (Tests executed, Results)
```

**Standardization Achieved**:
- Wave execution outputs SITREP ✅

- Phase planning outputs SITREP ✅
- All saved to Serena MCP with unique IDs ✅

**Impact**:
- SITREP Protocol compliance: 30% → **90%+** (from specification compliance analysis)
- Communication now standardized across ALL system components
- User receives consistent, structured status reports
- Aligns with specification: "SITREP is THE communication protocol"

**Commits**:
1. feat(skills): Add shannon-status-reporter (33b9c5c)
2. feat(skills): Update shannon-wave-orchestrator to output SITREPs (5c9353a)
3. feat(skills): Update shannon-checkpoint-manager to generate checkpoint SITREPs (cf0dec9)
4. feat(skills): Update shannon-phase-planner to output planning SITREPs (c62ea9e)

## What Needs Attention

### 1. Complete Skill Library (31% remaining)

**Need**: 4 remaining Priority 1B skills
- shannon-goal-tracker
- shannon-serena-manager
- shannon-context-restorer
- shannon-mcp-validator

**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours using meta-skill workflow

**Priority**: **MEDIUM** (skills work without these, but they enhance the experience)

### 2. Complete Command Refactoring (69% remaining)

**Need**: 9 remaining Shannon commands to skill-first format
- /sh:spec, /sh:status, /sh:memory, /sh:north_star, /sh:check_mcps, etc.

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours (pattern established, bulk refactoring)

**Priority**: **HIGH** (this completes the skill-first transformation)

### 3. Demonstrate End-to-End Workflow

**Need**: Show complete flow:
```
/sh:spec → shannon-spec-analyzer (8D analysis)
  ↓
shannon-skill-generator (generate project skills)
  ↓
/sh:plan → shannon-phase-planner (5-phase plan)
  ↓
/sh:wave 1 → shannon-wave-orchestrator (execute wave)
  ↓
Validation gate → Progress to wave 2
```

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

**Priority**: **HIGH** (proves the system works end-to-end)

### 4. QualityGate Hook Implementation

**Need**: Python implementation of QualityGate hook
- Currently defined in hooks.json
- Logic not implemented
- Blocks validation between waves

**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes

**Priority**: **MEDIUM** (nice-to-have, not blocking)
