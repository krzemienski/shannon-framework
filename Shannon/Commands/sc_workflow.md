# /sc:workflow - Enhanced Workflow Orchestration Command

> **Shannon V3 Enhancement**: SuperClaude's `/workflow` command enhanced with wave-based workflow orchestration, 5-phase integration, systematic validation gates, and structured execution templates.

## Purpose Statement

Comprehensive workflow orchestration that transforms specifications into structured execution plans:

- **5-Phase Integration** - Aligns workflows with Discovery → Architecture → Implementation → Testing → Deployment
- **Wave-Based Orchestration** - Parallel execution of workflow stages through specialized sub-agents
- **Validation Gate System** - Mandatory checkpoints between workflow phases with approval gates
- **Structured Templates** - Pre-built workflow patterns for common project types
- **Context Preservation** - Complete workflow state saved to Serena MCP across sessions
- **Progress Tracking** - Real-time workflow status with milestone visualization
- **Dependency Management** - Automatic task ordering based on dependency analysis
- **Resource Optimization** - Intelligent workload distribution across sub-agents

**What Makes This Different**: SuperClaude's `/workflow` provides basic task coordination. Shannon's `/sc:workflow` orchestrates complex multi-phase projects with parallel execution, systematic validation, and complete context preservation.

## Shannon V3 Enhancements Over SuperClaude

### 1. Wave-Based Workflow Execution (NEW)
**SuperClaude**: Sequential task execution
**Shannon**: Parallel workflow orchestration with wave coordination

```yaml
wave_workflow_execution:
  wave_1_discovery:
    parallel_tasks:
      - requirements-analyst → Requirements finalization
      - system-architect → Technical research
      - business-analyst → Stakeholder analysis

  validation_gate_1:
    required: "User approval of discovery outputs"

  wave_2_architecture:
    parallel_tasks:
      - system-architect → System design
      - database-architect → Data model design
      - integration-architect → API specifications

  validation_gate_2:
    required: "Architecture approval before implementation"

  wave_3_implementation:
    parallel_waves:
      - frontend-developer → UI implementation
      - backend-developer → API implementation
      - devops-engineer → Infrastructure setup
```

### 2. 5-Phase Integration (ENHANCED)
**SuperClaude**: No phase structure
**Shannon**: Explicit 5-phase alignment with effort distribution

```yaml
phase_integration:
  phase_1_discovery:
    effort_percentage: 20%
    workflow_focus: "Requirements, research, planning"
    validation: "Requirements approval gate"

  phase_2_architecture:
    effort_percentage: 15%
    workflow_focus: "Design, specifications, diagrams"
    validation: "Architecture review gate"

  phase_3_implementation:
    effort_percentage: 45%
    workflow_focus: "Parallel wave execution"
    validation: "Code review + functional tests"

  phase_4_testing:
    effort_percentage: 15%
    workflow_focus: "Integration, E2E, performance"
    validation: "Test results approval"

  phase_5_deployment:
    effort_percentage: 5%
    workflow_focus: "Release, monitoring, documentation"
    validation: "Production deployment approval"
```

### 3. Validation Gate System (NEW)
**SuperClaude**: No systematic validation
**Shannon**: Mandatory gates with approval tracking

```yaml
validation_gates:
  gate_structure:
    - Pre-conditions: "What must be complete"
    - Validation criteria: "How to verify quality"
    - Deliverables: "Required outputs"
    - Approval: "User sign-off required"

  gate_enforcement:
    - Cannot proceed without approval
    - Serena tracks approval status
    - Rollback capability if issues found
```

### 4. Workflow Templates (NEW)
**SuperClaude**: Manual workflow creation
**Shannon**: Pre-built templates for common scenarios

```yaml
workflow_templates:
  - fullstack_web_app
  - mobile_app_development
  - api_backend_service
  - data_pipeline
  - infrastructure_automation
  - migration_project
  - refactoring_initiative
```

## Usage Patterns

**Basic Usage**:
```
/sc:workflow [project-name]
/sc:workflow "E-commerce Platform"
/sc:workflow @specs/project-spec.md
```

**With Template Selection**:
```
/sc:workflow [project] --template fullstack
/sc:workflow [project] --template mobile
/sc:workflow [project] --template api-service
/sc:workflow [project] --template custom
```

**With Phase Targeting**:
```
/sc:workflow [project] --start-phase 2
/sc:workflow [project] --phases 1-3
/sc:workflow [project] --skip-discovery
```

**With Wave Control**:
```
/sc:workflow [project] --waves 4
/sc:workflow [project] --sequential (disable parallelization)
/sc:workflow [project] --max-concurrent 3
```

**With Checkpoint Management**:
```
/sc:workflow [project] --auto-checkpoint
/sc:workflow [project] --checkpoint-interval 30m
/sc:workflow [project] --resume-from-checkpoint
```

    - "No blockers remaining"
    - "Stakeholder approval obtained"

  deliverables_required:
    - "document_name.md"
    - "artifact_name"

  approval_process:
    - Present deliverables
    - Address feedback
    - Obtain sign-off

  failure_action:
    - Return to phase
    - Address issues
    - Re-validate
```

### Automated Gate Checks

```yaml
automated_checks:
  code_quality:
    - Linting passes
    - Type checking passes
    - No TODO comments in production code
    - Test coverage ≥ 80%

  functional_validation:
    - All tests green
    - NO MOCKS (functional tests only)
    - Integration tests pass

  documentation:
    - README updated
    - API docs current
    - Inline documentation present

  security:
    - No secrets in code
    - Dependencies up-to-date
    - Security scan clean
```

## Context Preservation

### Serena Integration

**Workflow State Preservation**:
```yaml
serena_workflow_memory:
  workflow_plan:
    key: "workflow_plan_[project]"
    content: "Complete workflow definition with phases, waves, gates"

  phase_status:
    key: "phase_[N]_status"
    content: "Current phase progress, deliverables, validation status"

  wave_results:
    key: "wave_[N]_results"
    content: "Completed wave outputs, decisions, issues"

  gate_approvals:
    key: "gate_[N]_approval"
    content: "Approval status, feedback, timestamp"

  checkpoint_state:
    key: "workflow_checkpoint_[timestamp]"
    content: "Complete workflow state snapshot"
```

**Session Operations**:
```
# Session start
1. read_memory("workflow_plan_[project]") → Load workflow
2. read_memory("phase_*_status") → Resume from last position
3. read_memory("gate_*_approval") → Check validation status

# During execution
1. write_memory("wave_N_results", outputs) → Save wave results
2. write_memory("phase_N_status", progress) → Update progress
3. write_memory("checkpoint_[timestamp]", full_state) → Create checkpoint

# Session end
1. write_memory("workflow_summary", final_state) → Save summary
2. list_memories() → Verify persistence
```
