# /sc:reflect - Enhanced Reflection Command

> **Enhanced from SuperClaude's reflection capabilities with Shannon V3 structured retrospectives, learning storage via Serena MCP, and systematic improvement tracking.**

## Command Identity

**Name**: /sc:reflect
**Base Command**: SuperClaude's reflection and introspection capabilities
**Shannon Enhancement**: Structured retrospectives, learning storage, pattern recognition, cross-session improvement
**Primary Domain**: Task reflection, learning extraction, continuous improvement, knowledge retention
**Complexity Level**: Low to Moderate (systematic analysis of completed work)

---

## Purpose Statement

The `/sc:reflect` command transforms post-task analysis into systematic learning and continuous improvement. It provides:

- **Structured Retrospectives**: Systematic analysis of what worked, what didn't, and why
- **Learning Storage**: All insights stored in Serena for cross-session improvement and pattern reuse
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring successes and failures across tasks
- **Improvement Tracking**: Monitor effectiveness of changes over time
- **Knowledge Retention**: Build organizational memory of best practices and lessons learned
- **Evidence-Based Insights**: All conclusions supported by specific task evidence

**SuperClaude Foundation**: Built on introspection mode and meta-cognitive analysis capabilities

**Shannon V3 Enhancements**:
- Structured retrospective templates (Start/Stop/Continue, Rose/Bud/Thorn)
- Learning storage via Serena with categorization and tagging
- Pattern recognition across multiple task reflections
- Improvement effectiveness tracking
- Integration with other commands for context-aware reflection
- Automated reflection triggers at task completion

  stop: "What should we STOP doing?"
  continue: "What should we CONTINUE doing?"
  effectiveness: 95%
  best_for: "Process improvements, habit formation"

rose_bud_thorn:
  rose: "What went well? (Successes)"
  bud: "What has potential? (Opportunities)"
  thorn: "What was challenging? (Problems)"
  effectiveness: 90%
  best_for: "Balanced emotional reflection, team retrospectives"

what_so_what_now_what:
  what: "What happened? (Observations)"
  so_what: "Why does it matter? (Analysis)"
  now_what: "What will we do? (Actions)"
  effectiveness: 92%
  best_for: "Learning extraction, action planning"

four_l_retrospective:
  liked: "What did we like?"

mad_sad_glad:
  mad: "What made us frustrated?"
  sad: "What disappointed us?"
  glad: "What made us happy?"
  effectiveness: 85%
  best_for: "Emotional processing, team morale"
```

### 2. Learning Storage Architecture

**Serena Memory Schema**:

```yaml
reflection_structure:
  reflection_[timestamp]_[task]:
    task_context: "Original task description and goals"
    outcomes: "What was achieved"
    effectiveness: "Success rating and evidence"

    insights:
      what_worked: ["Specific successes with evidence"]
      what_failed: ["Specific failures with root causes"]
      unexpected: ["Surprises and emergent patterns"]

    patterns:
      tool_effectiveness: {tool: effectiveness_score}
      approach_success: {approach: success_rate}
      common_pitfalls: ["Recurring issues"]

    lessons_learned:
      technical: ["Technical insights"]
      process: ["Process improvements"]
      collaboration: ["Teamwork learnings"]

    improvements:
      immediate: ["Quick wins to implement now"]
      short_term: ["Changes to make within 1 week"]
      long_term: ["Strategic improvements"]

    evidence:
      metrics: {metric: value}
      artifacts: ["Links to outputs"]
      feedback: ["User/stakeholder feedback"]
```

**Pattern Recognition Storage**:

```yaml
pattern_[pattern_type]:
  occurrences:
    - {date, task, outcome, evidence}
  success_rate: float
  contexts: ["When this pattern appears"]
  recommendations: ["When to apply/avoid"]
  evolution: ["How pattern has changed over time"]
```

### 3. Automated Reflection Triggers

```yaml
trigger_conditions:
  task_completion:
    complexity: ">= moderate"
    duration: ">= 30 minutes"
    auto_trigger: true

  failure_detection:
    quality_gates_failed: true
    unexpected_outcomes: true
    auto_trigger: true
    priority: "high"

  milestone_completion:
    wave_completed: true
    phase_completed: true
    auto_trigger: true

  periodic:
    frequency: "end_of_session"
    condition: "tasks_completed >= 3"
    auto_trigger: optional
```

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Reflection
```bash
/sc:reflect @task_or_session

# Triggers structured retrospective on specified task or session
# Uses default template (Start/Stop/Continue)
# Stores insights in Serena
```

### Template-Specific Reflection
```bash
/sc:reflect @task --template rose_bud_thorn

# Uses specified retrospective template
# Options: start_stop_continue, rose_bud_thorn, what_so_what_now_what, four_l, mad_sad_glad
```

### Pattern Analysis
```bash
/sc:reflect --patterns "tool_effectiveness"

# Analyzes patterns across multiple reflections
# Identifies recurring successes and failures
# Provides recommendations based on pattern history
```

### Comparative Reflection
```bash
/sc:reflect @task1 @task2 --compare

# Compares approaches and outcomes across tasks
# Identifies what changed and why
# Extracts differential insights
```

### Learning Review
```bash
/sc:reflect --review-period "last_week"

# Synthesizes learnings from specified period
# Identifies improvement trends
# Validates effectiveness of implemented changes
```

## Execution Flow

### Phase 1: Context Gathering (10-15%)

**Step 1.1: Task Analysis**
```yaml
context_gathering:
  - Identify task scope and original goals
  - Review deliverables and outcomes
  - Collect metrics and evidence
  - Gather user/stakeholder feedback
  - Review tool usage and effectiveness
```

**Step 1.2: Previous Reflection Lookup (Serena)**
```bash
# Check for related previous reflections
serena.list_memories()
→ Filter for reflection_* and pattern_* memories
→ Load relevant previous insights
→ Identify recurring themes
```

**Step 1.3: Template Selection**
```yaml
template_selection:
  auto_select: true
  criteria:
    - Task complexity → Template depth
    - Emotional impact → Emotion-aware templates
    - Team context → Collaborative templates
    - Learning goals → Learning-focused templates
  fallback: "start_stop_continue"
```

### Phase 2: Structured Reflection (40-50%)

**Step 2.1: Template Application**
```yaml
reflection_process:
  - Apply selected template questions
  - Use Sequential MCP for systematic analysis

    action: "Avoid or fix"

  context_dependent:
    success_rate: "Varies by context"
    action: "Document conditions"
```

### Phase 4: Learning Extraction (15-20%)

  - Lessons Learned (categorized)
  - Improvement Recommendations (prioritized)
  - Evidence Appendix (supporting data)
```

**Step 5.2: Actionable Recommendations**
```yaml
recommendation_format:
  recommendation: "Specific action to take"
  rationale: "Why this will help (evidence-based)"
  priority: "high|medium|low"
  effort: "low|moderate|high"
  impact: "low|moderate|high"
  owner: "Who should implement"
  timeline: "When to implement"
```
