# Shannon Integration Tests

## Overview

## Test Requirements

### Dependencies
- pytest
- pytest-asyncio
- Shannon framework (all modules)

### No External Services Required
- ❌ No database required
- ❌ No Redis required
- ❌ No MCP servers required (graceful fallback)
- ✅ All tests use tempfile for persistence
- ✅ All tests create real in-memory data structures

### Optional: Serena MCP
- Tests check for Serena availability
- Skip gracefully if not configured
- Can run `enable_serena=True` if Serena configured

## Key Features

### 1. Real Parallelism Verification
Tests measure actual timing to PROVE parallel execution:
- Sequential 3x1s tasks = 3s
- Parallel 3x1s tasks = 1s
- Speedup factor: 2.5x+ (accounting for overhead)

### 2. Real File I/O
Tests use tempfile for real filesystem operations:
- Create directories
- Write JSON files
- Read back data
- Verify persistence across "sessions"

### 3. Real Compression
Tests measure actual compression ratios:
- Store 10KB data
- Compress to <5KB
- Verify >50% reduction
- Decompress and validate

### 4. Real Learning
Tests track performance improvement:
- Initial: 10s execution time
- After 5 iterations: <8s execution time
- Measured improvement: 20%+

### 5. Real Consensus
Tests Byzantine fault tolerance:
- 4 nodes, 1 faulty
- Consensus reached: value 42
- Faulty node detected: 1
- PBFT phases completed: 3

## Test Quality Standards

### ✅ No Mocks
- Zero usage of unittest.mock
- Zero usage of MagicMock
- All test data is real

### ✅ Real Execution
- Real asyncio.gather() calls
- Real asyncio.sleep() delays
- Real timing measurements
- Real file system operations

### ✅ Measurable Outcomes

- Compression ratios (before vs after)
- Performance improvement (iteration 1 vs iteration 5)
- Consensus results (expected vs actual)

### ✅ Error Handling
- Tests verify graceful degradation
- Tests check for None/missing data
- Tests validate error messages
- Tests confirm recovery strategies
