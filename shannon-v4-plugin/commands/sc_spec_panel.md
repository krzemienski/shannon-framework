/sc:spec-panel - Enhanced Specification Review Panel

> **Shannon V4 Skill-Based Framework**: Progressive disclosure command with linked skills

## Purpose

## Purpose Statement

Shannon V3 enhances SuperClaude's expert specification review with **automatic 8-dimensional complexity scoring**, **phase planning integration**, and **specification improvement pattern recognition**. The command provides multi-expert analysis while simultaneously calculating objective complexity metrics that inform downstream phase planning and wave orchestration.

## Usage

### Basic Usage (SuperClaude Compatible)
```bash
/sc:spec-panel [specification_content|@file] [--mode discussion|critique|socratic] [--experts "name1,name2"] [--focus requirements|architecture|testing|compliance] [--iterations N] [--format standard|structured|detailed]
```
